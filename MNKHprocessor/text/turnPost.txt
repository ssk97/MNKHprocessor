Internal Politics

While Austria could not be inherently called a failure the division brought to the Presidium of the Council of Ministers and Seymonov's indecisiveness have still left a mark. The right wing that supported a non-interventionist course made the necessary compromises to ensure that no one important to the government spoke out against it but it was a near-cut thing. The supreme soviet's closed-door session was effectively filled with intensive debate over the topic, questioning the role of the general secretary at points even if the mood was nowhere near the issuance of a formal recall vote. Out of the right, only Gulyam even managed to sound respectable as he supported a more consistent consensus with enforcing socialism despite his other views.

Podgorny and Dzhussoev uncritically called for the backing of the Austrian reforms and government with broad support for the situation, support that would rapidly turn to little productive in the coming months. Immediate deregulation and the introduction of market mechanisms to goods in Austria led to a series of price increases across the general population with only primary agricultural commodities staying stable. After coming to their senses the Austrian government did manage to quell the following protests as economic reforms were under way but with every month the products of the reforms would be consistently negative. The reduction of the planned character of the economy was done carelessly with few involved capable of stopping the effective destabilization of local enterprises.

Support measures were passed in rapid succession to deal with the crisis with lower interest rate loans offered for restructuring along with direct support for the local government to gain control back of the workers. All the insistence that Dzhussoev and Gulyam had that the reforms were the only way to go for the Austrian economy became effective attacks on their positions, ensuring that their strange deviations could be decisively expunged from the economic norm. Some of their supporters are still expected to stay and those who are convinced that capitalist methods of accumulation and development are the only way forward will keep to their perspectives no matter the reality, but an effective discreditation of the right wing has been achieved.

Semyonov for his part has managed to only appear weak and indecisive, sparing him most of the criticism for any failures of local politics. Romanov even for his part did not expect the scale or nature of the crisis, though he at least moved decisively after the initial crisis with Seymonov to create a series of reforms and supports to prevent a further fracturing of Austrian politics and provide the workers of Austria some guarantees. On the left end, Kleschev did the world and the members of the Supreme Soviet a favor by dying of a heart attack early in the year, with large portions of his faction splintering and the largest part taken over by Mikhail Zimyanin, effectively an over-ambitious Pravda editor.

In the Supreme Soviet's legislative session, a new version of the criminal code has updated the standards for the treatment of the accused and standardized punishments for several crimes. The largest change has come in the reduction of time that suspects can be held to a week without extenuating circumstances. Escalation practices have further been standardized with escalatory decisions considered as final with formal protocols for supervision by higher courts. In the new criminal code, the largest changes have come with a codification of thousands of new crimes along with the specific penalties involved in them to avoid the use of non-specific and subjective reasoning that has consistently led to errors both in conviction and arrest.


Algerian War:

Algerian anti-colonial resistance in the non-directly occupied areas has steadily been attrited through the French application of further forces along with expanded domestic conscription to bring in fresh units. Any hopes of holding more comprehensive defensive positions in the Bechar-Ghardaia axis have so far failed with an increase in French commitments along with the tentative supply of American-made equipment to the forces involved. Algerian forces have continued to perform well in engagements where equivalent formations matched but those have become rarer as the war has gone on. Current fighting has centered around the remaining heights near In Salah where local supremacy in armor strength and strong defensive positions along with the sufficient deployment of mines have blunted French mass. Artillery inferiority has become a consistent problem at the front line as local guns and crews are under-trained, lacking in experience, and have so far received ammunition inadequate for more complex operations.

Partisan forces have conversely performed far better than ever expected with the French lines of advance limited to the primary logistical roadways through Adrar and roadways north of In Salah. Limited to non-existent control of the countryside has allowed for the practically free flow of arms to the partisans in the North, ensuring that the entire French depth is an unreliable corridor for aircraft and armor. Secondary directions of advance have also met considerable resistance but little progress has been made as the terrain is poor. Several proclamations by the French have been made on stopping the free flow of material to the Algerian forces, but this has fallen short both in terms of slow warfare in the deserts south of Ouargla and a general timidity in naval confrontation.

To maintain the coordination of supplies, freedom of navigation exercises have been conducted escorting weapons convoys into Libya with French forces consistently pushing for confrontation. Local naval patrols escorting shipments of weapons have been harassed by French naval forces with two frigates receiving some ramming damage in the attempts, but no crew have been significantly injured through the campaign. The Libyans for their part are effectively holding a significant number of weapons of those that pass through but that has been judged as an acceptable compromise for getting more arms into Algeria. Continued smuggling has already brought in hundreds of thousands of new anti-tank systems along with a steady stream of improving anti-aircraft weapons. Artillery ammunition is still short on the ground and the steady severe attrition of armored assets has limited larger-scale offensive action.

Comparative deficiencies of the Algerian forces have steadily been worn away under the intensity of the French attack, but the lack of initially available heavy assets has been a major limitation. The Algerian army is rapidly learning and adapting to French attacks but significant amounts of early combat power has already been lost. In the air efforts by volunteer pilots along with lighter anti-aircraft systems have kept supply corridors open under light interdiction but have accomplished little else. To support the partisan war, smuggled instructors have proven instrumental along with translated manuals to both French and Arabic, allowing equipment to be rapidly pressed into service to blunt the free movement of enemy forces. Behind the lines, resistance has only increased with the flight of the population to the countryside along with a continuous increase in the sophistication of attacks and the availability of light weapon systems.

In external diplomacy the news in the West has focused on the capture of a single volunteer from the Union, popularizing it as something of a struggle against communist influence. The Americans for their part have at length reported on how Soviet involvement in an anticolonial struggle has destabilized the region but they importantly have not moved outside of increasing equipment sales. Domestic response has also been lukewarm with several questions raised on the necessity of Soviet aid for a war that is almost certain to be conventionally lost against an escalating French presence. France has for its part gotten caught in several massacres by journalists with a domestic protest campaign starting against conscription and in response to mounting military casualties for what to the French public are negligible gains. Armament transfers are likely to continue for a few years but little impact is expected outside of temporarily tying down French forces and updating the current understanding of modern warfare.

Infrastructure: (10) 3 Dice

[]Western Passenger Rail Expansion: Proposals for improving passenger rail access towards Sevastopol and several Northern cities were made in the original project, but were later dismissed. This program would be split into the construction of a loop originating from Leningrad and going to Moscow through a Volkhov-Cherpovets-Volgoda direction with a small diversion to Gorky. In the South, a route from Dneiprovetsk to Sevastopol can be made with the line itself continuing to Krasnodar to provide further interlinks. Both projects are far smaller-scale constructions than the system as is but will expand services and ensure that experience in the construction of new rail is maintained. (160 Resources per dice 0/150)

[]Central Asian High Capacity Roads: Outside of the Western republics and inhabited belt, roads have historically been entirely ignored by every administration. Instead of the expected lack of economic activity and lack of development though, through socialist ingenuity, the Central Asian workers have achieved significant economic gains. Building up a long-distance transportation network from effectively nothing will take a massive investment in funds and personnel, but few things can generate a greater return either politically or economically than moving people used to dirt roads to large paved ones. Continued development funding will still be necessary, but even finalizing arterial routes will significantly improve standards and low-level commerce. (120 Resources per Dice 297/450)

[]Far Eastern High Capacity Corridor: Extending the construction of a high-capacity road corridor out to the Far East has been proposed and now can finally come into being. As the population in the region is primarily located along a single corridor work can be done for effective regional interlinks in a single project. The road itself will be an expansion on past programs with a standard two lines on each side extended to Vladivostok. A diversion towards Komsomolsk will of course be constructed to ensure that this project represents the logical conclusion to the initial road program. (120 Resources per Dice 0/175)

[]Water Distribution Systems(Stage 7/10): Calls for bringing universal pressurized water to every significant concentration of the population have been delayed for much of a decade but they can finally be entirely developed. Work on the construction of enlarged distribution infrastructure along with small integrated water towers will form much of the supply system, with much of the funding going towards the laying of new pipes before significant road renovations. New materials are available for modern plumbing, bringing the areas into the 20th century and ensuring that backwardness can be stamped out on the infrastructural end. (150 Resources per Dice 141/300) (-21 CI1 Electricity)

[]Civilian Airports(Stage 3/5): Work on an enlarged system of airports has proven to be problematic as the immense promises of the HSR system have only applied West of the Urals. Building up more airports for remote destinations and areas outside the grid is immensely necessary to ensure the regularity of passenger flights and continue the general development of the Union. Many are willing to take the slow line across the entire nation to travel, but vacation days are limited. Business integration severely benefits from a developed air-transportation system allowing for faster meetings and significant improvements in organization. Mail delivery can also be sped up considerably as the air service is expanded, bringing far faster delivery times to every corner of the Union. (110 Resources per Dice 30/125)

[]Development of the Volga: As a first stage of improving the water levels of the Volga and stabilizing the depletion of the Caspian a new canal system linking the basin of the Kama to the Perchora can be undertaken. Pioneering work on nuclear charges is expected to be utilized for the clearing of select hardpoints of terrain but much of the work is going to be conventional despite the climate. Improving water transfer will allow for the direct control of the water level of the Volga, helping to eliminate a significant scope of seasonal variation in the levels of the Volga. The canal may also help the development of the north, as a further accessible route towards the Arctic will be available for navigation. (120 Resources per Dice 39/75)

[]ESA: Improving ministry capacity has always been politically challenging, but with the incorporation of several of the latest machines a narrowing of personnel is possible. The full digitization of records remains impossible but several aspects can be improved. Calculating power will be made universally available through the procurement of a massive number of desktop units, automating significant amounts of labor. Further work towards improving the ministry will involve the purchase of almost ten thousand facsimile machines. These will primarily take over from the old system of sending letters, enabling every branch of the ministry to work more efficiently. (200 Resources per Dice 0/250) (Gain of Dice)


Heavy Industry (16) 10 Dice

[]Kursk Steel Mills(Stage 1/2): The massive magnetic anomaly under Kursk represents the prime center of Soviet steel production with massive reserves of ore and a location favorable to development both due to educated labor and due to a proximal source of high-quality coals. Work on the development of an even larger steel complex around the KMA will take funding and time, but it can be done. Several massive steel mills can be built in the area to start the decisive move towards increasing production and continuing the drive to triple-lap American steel production. The construction industry is not slowing nor are export industries and every ton of steel made is a ton that can contribute to Soviet infrastructure.

[]Donets Coal Basin Mechanization: Planned developments of the Donets basin have been modernized and rationalized to enable a massive increase in coal yields through the incorporation of specialized machinery. More trained personnel can be moved into the industry allowing for a general increase in development and allowing for the far more optimal exploitation of narrow deep seams. There isn't much more potential the basin itself can yield, but it can be made to serve to at least carry the Union over for a few years until cheaper coal is available. (175 Resources per Dice 0/125) (-17 CI2 Electricity -8 Coal -1 General Labor +1 Educated Labor)

[]Kuzbas Deposit Exploitation(Stage 4/5): The challenges of mining coal in narrower seams and at greater depths are ones that many of the personnel working on the current projects are familiar with. Previous experiences in the Donbas mines have gone both deeper and for narrower seams and current operations are considerably easier. The limitations of underground coal extraction are still significant as the labor demand is far higher than other methods. Production can still be significantly expanded with a healthy reserve but limits of economic extraction are still approaching. (120 Resources per Dice 8/200) (-48 CI6 Electricity -12 Coal +2 General Labor +1 Educated Labor)

[]Kansk-Achinsk Basin Exploitation(Stage 2/5): Initial experiments of a microwave-driven coal dehydration process have more than confirmed themselves in testing. The enhanced use of the river routes along with the transportation of effective semi-coke has allowed for significant efficiency improvements. As there are almost seventy million tons of sub-bituminous and lignites in the deposit, extraction is expected to make up the majority of coal produced in the Union. To compensate for the depletion of Western deposits extraction will have to be further increased with a mass transfer of personnel to mining. The surface-level coals here do allow for far more efficient extraction per worker, producing coal almost ten times more efficiently than underground deposits. (150 Resources per Dice 106/150) (-60 CI3 Electricity -12 Coal +1 General Labor)

[]Atomash(Stage 1/3): The development of a dedicated center of reactor manufacturing has been theorized through much of the past plan with little concrete work done on development. Now that the nation has mobilized massive industrial and technical resources the project itself can be made into a reality. The plant itself is meant for the series assembly line production of VVER-1000 cores along with several facilities for the production of associated turbines and machinery. The project represents one of the largest economic investments and is going to be definitive for the economy of Rostov. Initial production lots will take at least two years to improve production to scale from completion with current plans calling for the capacity to produce four nuclear cores per year.

[]Kiev Machine Building Plant: With the collapse of Gorky and the distribution of equipment across the enterprises the nation still faces a partial crisis in the form of tooling production. Domestic production for the lower end is more than sufficient but machinery for heavier industrial lines along with supporting production is still inadequate. Moving considerable funding towards expanding local production and ensuring that general-purpose heavy tooling is made at scale will be essential for further expansions of heavy industry. The steel and coal industry are not slowing down any time soon and a continued production of new equipment will be essential to keep both modern and expanding.

[]Saratov Machine Building Plant: Petrochemical extraction has only gotten more complex in the last decade with simpler drilling rigs becoming both outdated and inefficient. Rather than resorting to an increase in secondary recovery techniques, deals can be made with the Americans to import both expertise and technologies for increasing oil extraction. The industry itself is considered to be secondary to direct defense applications and the current relations offer a window where some technical exchanges can be conducted. The item most of interest is the production of new generation slant drilling equipment along with expertise in its operation, as domestic production will be able to learn important lessons and develop its innovative industry in the field.

[]Tupolev Factory Expansion: With the rapid development of the aviation sector the question of actually producing enough new airframes has been raised several times. Previous airframes have derived from older bomber airframes eliminating several sources of issues but a new mass complex for the production of aircraft is needed. Tupolev currently is the most likely to push both new models of plane into mass production, ensuring that any provided financial support is rapidly returned. Domestic lines will be rapidly scaled and iterated to provide enough airframes to start replacing il-16 derivatives in the current service and relegate the plane to mail service and secondary military roles.

[]Baltic Sea Shipyards: With the critical importance of the Northern trade corridor the Union must keep up with the West on the development of heavier modular container ships. Current yards have been constructing vessels capable of matching the performance of some smaller ships while building experience but far larger and more capable ships are needed. The restrictions of the Panama Canal cannot yet be overtaken and likely should not, but heavier shipping can be built. A new standardized design for ships of up to thirty thousand tons deadweight and the capacity to carry three thousand standardized containers. Production is expected to start in short order, ensuring that the Union can stay independent on shipping tonnage. (200 Resources per Dice 0/250) (-46 CI4 Electricity +4 Steel +2 General Labor +1 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Black Sea Shipyards: The more developed black sea shipbuilding complex has historically formed a core of production for the riverine network and several lighter vessels. Adapting the local labor there for the production of several heavier craft along with a new generation of diesel barges is expected to reduce costs and expand domestic productive capacity. The local yards are mostly adequate and contain some of the largest concentrations of trained workers for the production of new vessels. Current plans call for a near-doubling of production for riverboat tonnage along with a focus on producing bulk haulers capable of carrying non-containerized exports overseas.

[]Volga Automotive Plant Modernization: New technologies promise to utterly revolutionize car manufacturing to a never-before-seen scale. A unified moving line with the semi-autonomous addition of components alone promises to greatly improve throughput with tooling continuously improved to keep costs as low as possible. Local labor is now sufficiently experienced for massive expansions allowing skilled workers to take the lead on new developments. Large-scale industrial robotics has already been pioneered in the West making current programs essential to close the gap. (250 Resources per Dice 0/175) (-74 CI3 Electricity +5 Steel +2 Educated Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Gorky Automotive Plant Modernization: With a specialization in the production of different models of cars and providing direct competition to VAZ, the modernization of the Gorky plant is also essential. Industrial automation is expected to significantly improve production with a new generation of cars already developed incorporating several major improvements. A strong increase in automotive manufacturing in Gorky is expected to help local employment, providing tens of thousands of high-paying jobs with new automated lines. (250 Resources per Dice 0/175) (-79 CI5 Electricity +5 Steel +1 Educated Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]ZIL Automotive Plant Modernization: The luxury car mix of the Union has always been more of a light sports car than a true luxury car, but neither production nor demand has slackened. Massively expanding the factories around Moscow and introducing new industrial automation promises to greatly increase throughput and allow the adoption of new advanced construction techniques. The plant itself is technically smaller than either of the two major plants but the vehicles produced are expected to have far greater returns.

[]Inflatable Section Experiments: Launching an FGB-VA with the VA vehicle carrying an inflatable habitable section on its adaptor can prove the concept for future orbital work. The effective section itself will be a balloon designed to provide expansive living space for a theoretical crew with the conditions inside measured and monitored. If the test system works it can form a basis for the development of more advanced habitats, saving launch weight for a station program and enabling the construction of far larger experimental setups. Further, if the concept proves viable larger structures along the lines of centrifuges can be built to allow for more permanent orbital habitation in a decade. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Reusable Launchers: The initial MKAS program following the PKA was dismissed by Glushko as an impossible engineering nightmare but it can still be resumed for the sake of providing a lighter launch vehicle. Using long-burning hydrogen engines along with a reusable launcher attached to a drop tank will improve launch capacity and especially if paired with a carrier aircraft reduce costs. The technologies for the project itself are available today with the only issue being the degree of complicated engineering work. It is believed to be possible that some form of the MKAS concept could be launched in the decade allowing space to be opened to low-cost space launch. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Bulk Launch Methods: The rocket has historically been the only way that payloads and humans have gotten into space, but several other concepts deserve exploration. Everything from structural and design elevations on orbital cable elevators to rocket sleds must be considered. This program itself is only expected to be theoretical and focused on making designs for the possibility along with several small-scale models for scientific viability. Some plans have already been dismissed but investing in the future potential of orbit and easy delivery to space has always been a cornerstone of the program. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Mars Sample Return: The Mars program has demonstrated that a lander can be launched and landed on the surface but further steps are needed to develop the techniques necessary for landing a larger craft. The RLA-3 has the throw weight necessary for providing a heavy enough lander and the capacity for a sample return but the technologies involved are still purely theoretical. A series of heavier landers with accompanying rovers can be developed to test landing systems. Assuming an ideal timeframe would allow a sample return before the end of the decade along with the development of hardware capable of a partially propulsive landing. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Station Program: With the availability of the RLA-3 for the launch of very heavy payloads, nothing prevents the development and launch of a forty-ton habitable module to orbit. The module will then be crewed through a conventional launch of the FGB-VA bus along with the transfer of experiments and technologies aboard. The development of a whole new spacecraft will take some time, but starting work towards the sustained habitation of space can enable further projects in low earth orbit and truly long-duration experiments. Current limitations in electrical and thermal systems will be the major limit on the duration of these integrated stations, but if the next decade can replicate the gains of the last ten years those will be blown past. (-25 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Mercury Exploration Program: Current techniques and probes are sufficient for the flyby of mercury, with the main limitation falling towards the boost stage. Due to the problematic orbit of mercury, an intercept requires a massive degree of velocity to even attempt. Combining an RLA-3 along with a newly developed enlarged interplanetary stage is one proposal for such a mission allowing for an easy capability expansion without new technical developments. The stage will use the same engines and same tankage techniques if significantly scaled up for increased capability. Orbiting mercury is beyond any developed rocket, but a theoretical nuclear engine may be able to fix that. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]CMEA Payloads: Comecon has always wanted to launch more tonnage but at the current rates that has been questionable. Fully bringing the space program into international prominence can help any member nation deliver non-military payloads to space for a nominal cost, further improving scientific return and justifying the massive investments made to the RLA. Most of the payloads have come as a part of the German and Indian programs but those alone are expected to be sufficient to keep the production capacity of RLA's saturated for the near future and ensure a steady increase in orbital development. The capitalist world is currently behind in space program integration and ensuring that CMEA fills the lists of below the US and Union is a practical diplomatic coup.

Light Industry (6) 6 Dice

[]Air Conditioner Plants(Stage 6/8): Further expansions to the conditioner program are expected to prove instrumental in increasing production and ensuring that older housing can be modernized with new equipment. Current rates of homebuilding are only accelerating through the state program and almost all new conditioning production is going to the current program. Continuing a wave of aggressive expansions will normalize demand in the non-state sector and ensure a steady modernization of much of the old housing stock. Even an obsolete apartment can be made comfortable with renovation and temperature control, providing an acute improvement to the people's quality of life.

[]Light Home Appliance Plants: Electrical vacuum cleaners and a new generation of heavy appliances are needed to meet the expanding boom in apartments and the demand for more advanced goods. Production of further items has steadily increased in the last few years but by providing seed capital for more new companies an increase in availability and internal competition can induce a general drive towards product improvements. Founding almost a dozen smaller plants to produce specialty equipment and house tools necessary for daily tasks can serve to make the market more competitive and bring more engineers into the system.

[]Second Generation Furnishings: Standardized and mass-produced furniture is well and good, but people have consistently pushed for more variety. By bringing in a few hundred designers and creating standard catalogs and styles with some collaboration of the private sector the general furniture production system can be modernized. Standardized styles can be consolidated and brought in from the private sector, taking reliable products and bringing them into primary circulation. Production and demand increases are sure to follow as a broader subset of industries are brought into the market and properly utilized. (120 Resources per Dice 0/125) (-16 CI4 Electricity +3 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Home Supplies Production: The development of supplies for private home renovation and general modernization has become a significant sector of private production. Introducing the state into the market and significantly increasing the supply of basic tools, materials, and parts can serve to increase private sector specialization. This will take some funding to break new enterprises into the sector and provide a more competitive landscape, but that can be done without too many issues.

Chemical Industry (12) 11 Dice

[]West Siberian Petroleum Fields(Stage 2/6): Now that initial settlement has established several northern communities further extraction of oil can continue. The Union's demand for petroleum has in the current moment been fulfilled but it is expected to strongly increase over the current plan. Expanded drilling programs are going to be needed to keep the Union supplied with enough fuel to continue economic growth as energy markets make up an essential part of any economic increase. Current drilling programs call for a general increase in the number of wells drilled, providing gains to production at a comparatively mild increase in costs as the technology is long-proven.

[]Timan-Pechora Fields: Under Exploitation of the deposits across the north has been typical but now that petrochemical demand is rapidly rising both domestically and across CMEA radical measures must be taken. Taking advantage of the already settled nature of the region, intensive exploratory drilling can start to recover the remaining local oil reserves. Local fields have already been partially tapped but less optimal deposits can start extraction with follow-on technical work done to ensure a steady increase in the production of oil and condensates.

[]Plastic Industries(Stage 2/5): With previously under-utilized heavy fractions of petroleum along with the limited utilization of local gas reserves a massive expansion of the plastics industry is still necessary. Even for Americans primary fiber production has shifted towards petrochemical sources. The Union with less of a chance to import conventional fibers should not be behind the states in adapting the newest methods of production. Continued investment will focus on significantly expanding the production of plastics in preparation for the production of synthetic fibers, starting the long process of catching up to and overtaking the Americans in the production of "synthetic" textiles.

[]Expanded Ammonia Plants: With new cultivars of dwarf wheat having a stronger fertilization response than older cultivars a general increase in the production of ammonia is necessary. Fertilizer intensity has only grown rapidly across the block and reducing the price of fertilizer is expected to be key for improving agricultural returns. If every small farmer can afford to use fertilizer and the education to use it well, smaller-scale production can more than overtake larger farms. Current programs will be focused on massive haber reactors to secure domestic supplies with facilities constructed to take advantage of available natural gas reserves.

[]Stabilization of Agrochemicals(Stage 1/2): Third-generation pesticides have made agriculture safer and cleaner than it has ever historically been. Precision destruction of insect hormonal systems allows for a near elimination of toxicity for farmers along with improved consumer safety. Improved targeting with highly specific auxin growth regulators promises to improve the precision of herbicidal agents along with several compounds specifically made to target broadleaf weeds. Increasing production of both will be a significant process but it can be done and will be essential to ensure that the agricultural sector can move away from more dangerous and less effective compounds.

[]Synthetic Rubber Plants(Stage 2/4): The demand for more rubber is massive and endemic across the whole economy. The recent spook with the Indonesian government turnover has left the rubber market struck with buy-ups and general increases in stockpiling, leaving prices rapidly spiraling up. Increasing production now will serve to provide a basis for many civilian industries and begin the direct breakaway from rubber import dependency while producing polymers more suited to the Union's climate. Synthetic production is not expected to overtake natural rubber unless massive funding is committed properly, but it needs to improve the quality of rubber and reduce the massive import dependency.

[]Domestic Meat Programs(Stage 4/10): Increasing the density of chicken production while animal stocks are steadily increased for further efforts. Continued improvements in sourcing and efficiency of feeds along with the steady gains in weight per hen are expected to steadily improve the efficiency of the entire meat sector. Funding is still necessary to ensure that the average Soviet worker can eat chicken every day, but with every step of the program that approaches ever closer. Drives towards improved feeds for improving the rate of bird survival and more advanced veterinary sciences have already improved yields. By expanding the general industry and standardizing them, further gains can be made. (105 Resources per Dice 12/250) (-26 CI1 Electricity +2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Farmers Markets: Access towards the mass sale of meat has always been questionable from small farms with meat production rendered excessively local. By establishing and helping to fund a series of local markets and encouraging grocers to stock local production significant gains can be made to the production of small farms. Dual-use agriculture is to an extent a fact of life with few small farms entirely specialized into a single crop or animal with farmers' markets allowing more varied craft produce to reach Soviet consumers. The funding of the program further promises to be cheap and encouraging local production can help with community involvement. (100 Resources per Dice 0/150)

[]Payments for Land Diversion: If control over planting is going to be delegated out to the farms, mechanisms to still produce desired outcomes can be implemented through the market system. Effectively paying farmers to keep a portion of fields fallow and rotated out while avoiding massive intensification of chemical products can provide some easy returns. This will cost the state money and be a further handout to the enterprises but at least land management outcomes can be improved. (140 Resources per Dice 0/125)

[]Water Management Programs: Officially admitting that water resources are limited and that no radical programs are coming to solve the problem is a monumental step. Limiting water itself is an open question and is almost certainly politically impossible but simple hardening and ensuring that catchment basins can be preserved can slow down the losses. An assessment of current irrigation works can be started to pioneer methods of reducing evaporation and increasing retention. Water savings are unlikely to reach even a fifth of required standards but buying more time for more effective measures is still worthwhile. (120 Resources per Dice 0/300)


Services (10) 3 Dice

[]Expanded Childcare(Stage 6/6): Continuous expansions in the childcare system are necessary to entirely spread it across the entire Union. The Western parts of the Union have reached a sufficient development of services but past the Urals, the services steadily become more questionable. With a final surge in funding a universal system that can handle the current birth rates can be constructed to provide enough capacity for another decade if current trends hold. Further efforts would be necessary but the effective expansion of services is a critical component to the satisfaction of families and significantly contributes to workforce participation. (80 Resources per Dice 237/325) (-10CI2 Electricity +2 General Labor) (Possible Increase in Workforce Participation)

[]Transportation Enterprises(Stage 3/5): Continuing the large-scale drive towards improving the transportation industry will be essential for continuing economic development. Previous programs have considerably improved transportation, reducing overall prices and stimulating the private sector. Increasing the scope of the program and integrating it with a general stores program can provide further improvements of transportation capacity all at the cost of founding some small enterprises. Continued truck imports are going to be needed to keep pace, but the funding exists to more than complete the program. (180 Resources per Dice 7/200) (+3 Petroleum Fuels +3 General Labor) (Stage 3 Max until Central Asian high capacity roads completed) (Very High Profitability)

[]Expanding Preparation Schools: Those going into university from a suboptimal educational background or general tracks have only steadily expanded in recent years. With the pressure to improve education, the question of sufficient preparation for entrance exams is pertinent and essential for improving student achievement. Taking over partially from the private sector several programs in mathematics and sciences can be started to allow more motivated students to improve their educations and compensate for poor previous performance in placements. The majority of institutions will run on the weekends and during the summer, providing opportunities and reducing scheduling conflicts. (100 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-8 CI2 Electricity +2 Educated Labor)

[]Development of Population Services: The rural workers have considerably been under-served by developments in population services and that to an extent can be reversed. Funding for the location of minor legal offices and several more bureaucratic services can be provided to enable the coverage of small towns. Local transportation capability is still severely limited restricting the efficiency of both construction and coverage but it must be done to provide basic services. Transportation and telephone integration is expected to somewhat compensate for lower density but that has left the program expensive and arguably inefficient. (120 Resources per Dice 0/250) (-12 CI2 Electricity +3 Educated Labor)

[]Town-Market Construction: Building up specialized stores for services towards the smallest towns represents a previously unconsidered logistical challenge. Local forms of production are still significant with the movement of goods limited by the lack of roads and density. Continued funding work can start towards increasing access to goods through subsidizing small retailers in a state-run model. Most will sell gasoline, diesel, and a few basic goods but that in itself will significantly improve commerce. Increased accessibility will allow money to be spent locally, boosting development. (115 Resources per Dice 0/125) (+2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Localized Transport Services: The development of localized bus networks has been deprioritized due to the state of roads but that can be more than fixed. Committing a massive quantity of funding towards establishing regional and local bus lines to enable low-density commuting is an essential priority. Effective transportation to and from most remote villages will be the priority along with some expansions in local transit. For smaller locations, just a single looping route will be established but for those approaching the size of a city, a fully interconnected system can be made. The actual buses will only cover the fares cost with some loss expected but economically stimulating effects will more than compensate.

Bureaucracy (8) 3 Dice (Supsov Selections marked by (Supreme Soviet)) (One Favor Available)

Prison Reform Program: Following the report of the Obukhov Commission on the prison crisis and seeking a way to modernize the industry several changes are expected to be implemented. Previous methods of increasing workforce participation have proven to be questionable in implementation with punishment proving to be a lacking implementation. Rather than focusing on punishment, the system can be shifted towards encouraging work through alternative means. New extended sentencing guidelines will be passed with the expectation that if a prisoner is participating in work programs the sentences will be effectively reduced. For those that do not work, this represents a near doubling of sentences but it will remove the incentives for the excessive punishment of non-working prisoners. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet)

Increasing Domestic Innovation: Domestic scientific production is becoming more and more instrumental in the mounting conflict with the capitalist world. Three dedicated grant funding organizations have been founded for the private sector and individual researchers operating outside the conventional university system to increase domestic innovation. Much of the grant money is certain to be wasted and misallocated but by providing technicians and engineers the chance to fulfill both state and commercial demand. Private labs have proven to be more agile than conventional academies and by increasing the funding provided a large number of novel technical solutions can be generated. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet)

Domestic Production Program: Balakirev has come to the arguably good political decision that the current struggle with trade balances makes a fertile political environment. Coming on hard to the fiber issue Balakirev has advocated for tariffs on imported fibers to improve the profitability of domestic production and strengthen industry discipline. This is to be accompanied by a strong subsidy for plants that utilize domestic petroleum by allowing them to fast-track several regulations to increase production as rapidly as possible. The full act is unlikely to pass, but some watered-down version is nearly certain to get through the Supreme Soviet, if only as a hanger-on to other legislation. (1 Dice) (Balakirev)

[]Dedicate Focus Towards a Project(): (1 Bureau Dice for +5 per dice on a project, +15 in services) (Unrolled)

[]Immigration Reforms: There is a desperate need for more labor primarily in non-university-educated segments of the population. Sourcing it domestically has already posed severe limitations with a lack of supply of new workers graduating from universities despite the post-war population boom. By burning some influence the general immigration laws can be further opened, allowing citizenship to be granted for strategic and technical education on an accelerated basis along with improving the flow of immigration throughout CMEA. Enterprises will further be allowed to sponsor as many applicants as desired, with cross-border applications directly allowed and pre-approved for any work that cannot be filled over three months with a domestic applicant. (Uses Favor) (1 Dice)

[]Expanded Education: More students need to go into the education system as the previous lengthening of terms is still working itself through the system. The priority will thus fall towards a comprehensive reform of the middling and lower paths of the education system to improve the performance of non-university-bound students. Technical school graduates will be offered a final year program that directly corresponds to a certification with automatic enrolment assuming a conclusion of the program and following work. To improve labor responses a considerable amount of funding can be pushed towards corrective institutions, compensating for children that would otherwise fall out of the system through an intensive program of boarding schools to re-introduce them to the standard curriculum. (Uses Favor) (1 Dice)

[]Pension Reform: Pension ages are still split between sixty and sixty-five with the former predominant amongst high-risk applications. Changing the actual ages would be nearly impossible but encouraging some of the pensioners to work until seventy should be doable by advocating for increased savings. Standardized state-backed deposit accounts with mild returns can be established for the pensioners along with several programs to encourage those in good health to keep working and build up both savings and an expanded pension. Most will likely ignore the offer, but even a few experienced workers staying on for a few years can significantly improve the labor force. (Uses Favor) (1 Dice)

[]Force a Euro Vote: The current economic crisis in CMEA is the perfect pretext for driving forward decisive reforms to improve integration and local economics. The Euro is still in its prototypical stages but something along the lines of a universal currency of interconvertibility can be implemented now. This would be an effective introduction of standards for national economies including maximum deficits outside emergency circumstances, a normalization of interest rates, and several financial standards otherwise only upheld in the Union and Germany. The new currency itself would serve as a transitional point, taking a basket of currencies across the block to keep its valuation stable while expanding its use for all inter-state banking transactions. (Uses Favor) (1 Dice)

[]Labor Cost Adjustments: Labor cost increases are only expected to increase as the Union continues its drive towards modernization leaving several sectors of the economy growing more expensive. Measures to control costs will have to be taken to provide for low-cost construction labor if development is to continue at the same pace. A full currency revaluation is beyond the scope of ability either politically or economically but several softer measures can be implemented. Reducing same-job cost increase maximums can allow current growth in labor costs to be slowed and improve the dynamism of labor by encouraging varied employment. (1 Dice)

[]Restructuring Bonus Allocations: The allocation of bonuses for worker performance has always been done at the managerial level but further efforts to improve allocations can be undertaken. Recentralizing the control of allocation towards lower level management for individual workers along with enforcing performance rating schemes can provide for a more dynamic and efficient environment. This will effectively decentralize the scheme along with implementing a formal rating system for most state enterprises ensuring that the most productive workers are compensated for their work. Bonus pay will further be publicized to ensure that rewards are fair and transparent, improving the worker's view of the system and eliminating any criticism of its allocation. (1 Dice)

[]Enterprise Benefits: Allowing enterprises to offer expanded benefits can be a means of reducing direct labor price raises while continuing to expand services. An enterprise partnering with state services at a larger scale can allow some savings to be provided along with ensuring that job offers are not a direct competition of funding. The largest factor of these is likely to be canteen costs being deferred along with partnerships with local businesses to provide services to workers for free. Little reductions are expected from a full passage but even a tiny reduction in labor costs is an improvement to economic efficiency. (1 Dice)

[]Scientific Exchange Programs: Formalizing large-scale study and student programs to analyze foreign farming practices can improve domestic experiences and transfer new techniques. Much of what is learned will be more of an academic curiosity than useful information, but any improvement that can be made is an improvement. Borrowing techniques aren't expected to walk over any toes, as even the capitalists have not trademarked any methodologies. Expertise transfer is not expected to remotely work during this plan, but it can help in the next plan. (1 Dice)

[]Reorganize a Department(Choose Department): Working to appoint new ministers is going to be essential to ensure that the ministry itself can function. The separation of the light industrial and chemical department has been long expected but new deputies must be confirmed. There are likely to be some political costs but replacing any open position is comparatively simpler than attempting larger re-organizations. (1 Dice)


Current Economic Prices(Domestic/CMEA/International): (How this will work is that every action above except for electricity modifies the internal price of the commodities below. They also vary on their own and are sorted into abstracted 1-100 ranges. Modifiers from the rest of your economy are displayed below with each category of goods. When you shift between 20-sized ranges, there can be significant modifiers to the general economy that come from changing prices of core commodities. CMEA prices determine the price in CMEA, though transportation of goods will be a problem with international prices representative of the West.)
