Internal Politics:

Ashimov has only gotten more radical in stance before the election advocating for a new cultural revolution along with a strong push towards the rotation of cadres through any means. He has yet to formally break with the party but he currently exists as a concerned radical element looking to undermine the party in favor of some imagined concept of the workers. Thankfully, he has proven far too radical for anyone short of a disaffected student to respect limiting any likely political impact in the election. Kleshchev has instead moved towards a broader modernization of Stalinism bringing it to possibly only a decade out of date, maintaining the absolute power of the party apparatus but arguing for flexibility in all other matters.

Romanov has moved to a larger extent than ever before driving new legislation in the form of broad tax reform and becoming a champion of the people against the enterprises. The laws of the Union are perfectly sufficient for the task of governance with their implementation and enforcement being the main limitation. Recognizing this truth, the priority of his campaign has become one focused entirely on enforcing the laws as they are rather than chasing new and radical change. Kosygin for his part has attempted to stay apolitical for reasons beyond analysis and has practically focused everything on moving his successor onto the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The post is deeply secondary to Semyonov's party role but has effectively been a power grab toward state-centric power.

This has come as a product of a series of compromises and an unusually productive legislative agenda with legislation for everything from homosexuality to policies around agricultural taxes set to come up. Before the election, there was something of a scandal of politicians attempting to prove themselves rather than sitting still. Podgorny has aggressively pushed for several of the reforms as something of a rabble-rouser determined to change the Soviet system in strange and new ways. Romanov for his part has practically guaranteed the appointment of a series of more sympathetic ministers for a neutral stance, consolidating the party more for mild losses in an act of pragmatism to improve agreeability and reduce losses to younger cadres.

The two revisionists have been more focused on each other than anyone else, allowing the rest of politics to move on from their strange positions. Gulyam has attempted to push the radical policy of enterprise independence to a series of cadres with experience being dealt with by the enterprises, leading to massive messaging failures. Those still convinced that some strange market reforms are necessary have partially shifted towards Dzhussoev but even those are more misguided than anything. The commitment towards transforming the current system into one centered on capitalistic associations is a practical betrayal of both materialism and practical theory rendering it impractical and almost certain to receive little support.

Loss of coolant of the Chita-1 core leads to a short period of element exposure in the realm of conventional operation. Several fuel elements were lost in a partial meltdown before control of the core was re-established, forcing a shutdown and re-evaluation of both the emergency system and containment program. The core itself is mostly a write-off as little productivity could come from it. The overall power station is still functional and the radioactive release is only relevant from the standpoint of power production. According to technicians an error in core coolant coverage caused the accident with feed pumps insufficient to supply emergency coolant. Future cores are expected to remedy both issues with the only practical consequence being some mild local discontent from a rushed evacuation.

Several papers on both sides of the ideological conflict have been published remarking on a remarkable phenomenon of the modification of terrestrial albedo through the release of carbon dioxide. Current briefings have indicated the effect as mild and strongly beneficial for the Union as increases in temperature are expected to increase arable territory while coming at practically little cost. Further, if arctic temperatures increase significantly the sheer commercial potential of accessible northern ports and mineral reserves cannot in any way be under-estimated. Opening the mines in good conditions with good logistics will significantly improve the economy of the Union faster than almost any other proposed logistical project.


Rocketry:

Continued exploration of Mars has delivered results in the form of the launch of the first payload capable of entering orbit around the planet. Using a capture maneuver in the atmosphere the orbiter will proceed to map the magnetic fields and continuously take pictures of the surface of the red planet. Continued programs are almost certain to use the comprehensive radar altimetry information and photographs to enable a lander program to further space exploration and deliver massive amounts of new information. A new generation of rovers is expected as the delivery of payloads to the surface is challenging due to the thin atmosphere. Re-entry trajectories and a lack of parachute effectiveness will have to be taken into account to create a practical landing.

The first series of civilian communication satellites have come as the direct conclusion to the military program with a limited capacity for satellite communications guaranteed across the planet. The network itself has been opened to all ships sailing under CMEA or associated flags, allowing distress calls to go directly through the satellite system. Data transmission is still slow due to technical limitations and the current constellation is optimistically only expected to last half a decade but it is a massive achievement. Work on the atmospheric program has gone similarly with accurate maps of weather created to allow reliable climate predictions well outside the scope of terrestrial radars.

Almost ten kilograms of lunar regolith has at this point been returned to the earth with several landers now targeted towards more challenging targets. The craters represent something of immense scientific curiosity with landings expected at several to study the composition. Further developments on the program are even expected to land a new heavy rover system, powered by an RTG and capable of independent operation. The rover itself will be made primarily to retrieve information and continue the transmission of photographs but something along the lines of a wide area sample return mission has already been proposed, allowing for a wide range of further studies.

Infrastructure: (16) 9 Dice

[]Integration of Commuter Rail: The old program to revamp and unify commuter rail with subways is still viable despite massive changes in the ministry. Disruption from the sacking of the corrupt imbecile has been fairly mild. The program has effectively been modified to include Kiev, Minsk, Tashkent, and Kharkov ensuring a more even spread of development. Further work will inherently center on ensuring that above-ground use in the high-speed rail zone is directly utilized by local transit grids, bringing stations together and forming large linkage lines to allow for traveling passengers to reach the most significant urban areas quickly and cheaply (115 Resources per dice 0/175)

[]Ural Regional Roads: Continued development of local infrastructure is a logical extension of previous programs and a near requirement given the Supreme Soviet. Work on these roads will drive towards a general improvement in transportation focused on improving the interconnections between the Northern and Southern inhabited corridors. The terrain will allow for a massive increase in the paved kilometers of roads and improve local transportation. As one of the centers of newly developing industries and a core of natural resource utilization, roads will produce a massive economic return and practically pay for themselves through increasing economic turnover. (100 Resources per Dice 355/400)

[]Central Asian High Capacity Roads: Outside of the Western republics and inhabited belt, roads have historically been entirely ignored by every administration. Instead of the expected lack of economic activity and lack of development though, through socialist ingenuity, the Central Asian workers have achieved significant economic gains. Building up a long-distance transportation network from effectively nothing will take a massive investment in funds and personnel, but few things can generate a greater return either politically or economically than moving people used to dirt roads to large paved ones. Continued development funding will still be necessary, but even finalizing arterial routes will significantly improve standards and low-level commerce. (100 Resources per Dice 114/500)

[]Central Asian Regional Roads: Local movement of goods has been a consistent factor of life across the Central Asian republics, but even enabling a paved route towards the nearest railway hub can allow for significant transport improvements. Many of the regional roads will be built as rationalized two-lane endeavors through the mostly underutilized countryside, ensuring that major enterprises can keep goods almost entirely on paved surfaces. Urban development will continue alongside the larger road system, ensuring that every town and every city has a linkage to the general transportation system. The development of links outside the region is outside of this effort, but just improving local transport should deliver massive returns. (100 Resources per Dice 22/500)

[]Water Distribution Systems(Stage 7/10): Calls for bringing universal pressurized water to every significant concentration of the population have been delayed for much of a decade but they can finally be entirely developed. Work on the construction of enlarged distribution infrastructure along with small integrated water towers will form much of the supply system, with much of the funding going towards the laying of new pipes before significant road renovations. New materials are available for modern plumbing, bringing the areas into the 20th century and ensuring that backwardness can be stamped out on the infrastructural end. (120 Resources per Dice 39/350) (-14 CI1 Electricity)

[]Civilian Airports(Stage 3/5): Work on an enlarged system of airports has proven to be problematic as the immense promises of the HSR system have only applied West of the Urals. Building up more airports for remote destinations and areas outside the grid is immensely necessary to ensure the regularity of passenger flights and continue the general development of the Union. Many are willing to take the slow line across the entire nation to travel, but vacation days are limited. Business integration severely benefits from a developed air-transportation system allowing for faster meetings and significant improvements in organization. Mail delivery can also be sped up considerably as the air service is expanded, bringing far faster delivery times to every corner of the Union. (85 Resources per Dice 34/150)

[]Unified Canal System(Step 3/3): The massive modernization of the interior and opening of the Caspian Sea as a logistical destination cannot happen with the current limitations of the Volga-Don Canal. By decisively utilizing the lowered ground of the Kuma-Manych Depression a new route can be constructed away from any limitations in tonnage and with a minimal number of locks. This would enable far heavier shipping to move into Caspian ports, providing a massive economic stimulus. Simultaneously, the further opening of the Volga network to faster and larger traffic can expand the economic potential of the rest of the canal system, improving economic turnover. (85 Resources per Dice 19/175)

[]Development of the Volga: As a first stage of improving the water levels of the Volga and stabilizing the depletion of the Caspian a new canal system linking the basin of the Kama to the Perchora can be undertaken. Pioneering work on nuclear charges is expected to be utilized for the clearing of select hardpoints of terrain but much of the work is going to be conventional despite the climate. Improving water transfer will allow for the direct control of the water level of the Volga, helping to eliminate a significant scope of seasonal variation in the levels of the Volga. The canal may also help the development of the north, as a further accessible route towards the Arctic will be available for navigation. (120 Resources per Dice 0/75)

[]Power Grid Expansions: The localization of power production and the increase in the development of local power systems can only push off general grid modernization for so long. The increasing demands for power and massive construction efforts during the current plan must be compensated for to continue acute development and maintain stable grid balances. Work towards expanding the high voltage grid is expected to be prioritized, but further work towards improving the safety of local grids and modernizing low-level transmission wiring is expected to follow. There is no reason to accept the increased fire risk of old-style wiring when modern alternatives are both cheaper and more efficient. (100 Resources per Dice 251/275)


Heavy Industry (10) 7 Dice

[]Kursk Steel Mills(Stage 1/2): The massive magnetic anomaly under Kursk represents the prime center of Soviet steel production with massive reserves of ore and a location favorable to development both due to educated labor and due to a proximal source of high-quality coals. Work on the development of an even larger steel complex around the KMA will take funding and time, but it can be done. Several massive steel mills can be built in the area to start the decisive move towards increasing production and continuing the drive to triple-lap American steel production. The construction industry is not slowing nor are export industries and every ton of steel made is a ton that can contribute to Soviet infrastructure. (160 Resources per Dice 0/200) (-26 CI6 Electricity -10 Steel +3 Coal +2 General Labor +1 Educated Labor)

[]Bakchar Deposit Utilization(Stage 2/3): Continued funding programs aimed at improving steel yields from new deposits can still be undertaken in a rationalized form. The increases in labor that accompanied the establishment of a new city have mostly passed allowing for continuous development. Improvements in mill automation are expected to be trialed at a local level to reduce labor demands by the ever-growing steel complex and improve profitability as constructed. Technical challenges still abound due to the lower grades of iron but to a large extent, even those have been overcome. (150 Resources per Dice 116/200) (-29 CI5 Electricity -8 Steel +1 Coal +2 General Labor +2 Educated Labor)

[]Mangyshlak Arc-Mills: Utilizing lower-grade quartzite deposits that are prevalent in the region along with an arc furnace final conversion of pig iron promises to ensure a stable supply of metal for the prolonged future. The deposits of what was previously considered to be secondary ore are massive and well beyond the scope of conventional ore. Further, to adequately utilize the massive development of local hydroelectric potential, the power must be directed toward economic uses. By centralizing the processing of low-grade ore the region can start a new mining revolution. Further, increasing quantities of scrap steel can be repurposed economically, bringing overall prices down. Utilization of local coals is further expected to make the price impact negligible, improving yields. (180 Resources per Dice 0/200) (-10 Steel +2 General Labor +2 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Donets Coal Basin Mechanization: Planned developments of the Donets basin have been modernized and rationalized to enable a massive increase in coal yields through the incorporation of specialized machinery. More trained personnel can be moved into the industry allowing for a general increase in development and allowing for the far more optimal exploitation of narrow deep seams. There isn't much more potential the basin itself can yield, but it can be made to serve to at least carry the Union over for a few years until cheaper coal is available. (140 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-12 CI2 Electricity -8 Coal -1 General Labor +1 Educated Labor)

[]Sevastopol Technical Equipment Plants: The Gorky dominance on machine tooling has served to slow the production of new equipment and while standards have improved throughput, they have only served to stagnate general industry. By combining computerization in the lightest units along with a guided numerical control mill, further advanced machining methods can be produced at scale. The production involved will be expensive both in experts and the techniques involved, but the highest quality machine tools must be made at a significant scale for proper utilization. The introduction of a further sector of technical production will also provide a vector for competition, ensuring steady development. (280 Resources per Dice 89/150) (-65 CI9 Electricity +2 Steel +3 Non-Ferrous +1 General Labor +3 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Kuzbas Deposit Exploitation(Stage 4/5): The challenges of mining coal in narrower seams and at greater depths are ones that many of the personnel working on the current projects are familiar with. Previous experiences in the Donbas mines have gone both deeper and for narrower seams and current operations are considerably easier. The limitations of underground coal extraction are still significant as the labor demand is far higher than other methods. Production can still be significantly expanded with a healthy reserve but limits of economic extraction are still approaching. (100 Resources per Dice 8/225) (-31 CI4 Electricity -12 Coal +2 General Labor +1 Educated Labor)

[]Kansk-Achinsk Basin Exploitation(Stage 1/5): The solution to the Union's coal and energy issues is not some technical miracle or novel development. With any limitation in transportation, defeated coal production can be shifted towards deposits of easy surface utilization. The massive surface fields of lower-grade coals offer an almost order of magnitude improvement in labor efficiency for production. Haulage costs are expected to increase final prices by half of the value of coal despite the improvements, but technical efforts towards the dehydration and semi-coking of coal can be undertaken on-site using new techniques and local hydroelectric energy. (120 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-36 CI3 Electricity -12 Coal +1 General Labor +1 Educated Labor)

[]Volga Automotive Plant Expansion: There is no practical end to the demand for more automobiles and while Voznesensky's insane promise of producing eight million cars per year was impractical, we are already halfway there. Incentive fund expansions are only likely to continue at scale for the new enterprises of the Union and kickstarting one for one of the largest automotive complexes in the Union can help significantly. New model production along with improvements in techniques promise to revolutionize the automotive industry with entirely domestic designs. Improvements in production methodology will also serve to lower prices, offering cars domestically and abroad for far less per unit. (180 Resources per Dice 0/200) (-35 CI3 Electricity +4 Steel +2 General Labor +2 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Novouralsk Truck Plant: Domestic cab-over production has universally been in shortage with several expensive imported models making up critical areas of the stock. Work on replacing these must be prioritized to reduce expenses and ensure that domestic high-capacity models can be made. The technical development of a viable set of trailers and a standardized cab has already been completed from other initiatives leaving only the question of manufacturing. A semiautomated unified line plan has been developed and checked for excessive spending, allowing a local factory to be set up to produce the heaviest of trucks.

[]Replace Glushko: The man has had his little triumph of returning lunar soil and achieved several orbital victories, but he is still abrasive in the extreme and practically from the past era. His area of expertise in rocket engine optimization has been rendered mostly obsolete by his developments and more junior members are excited to address future challenges facing the space program. Replacing him will not come easily as the program has effectively been built around his OKB, but now is the time for bureaucratic reorganization and the further consolidation of the space program into a single body instead of the not entirely functional system of junior and senior OKBs. (1 Dice)

[]Nuclear Drives: The promise of a viable high-thrust nuclear drive for the launch of a payload into the outer system is practically astronomical. A two-stage moon mission in the American scheme could be conducted with our current rockets assuming a hydrogen stage, additionally, the massive requirements for velocity for exploring the outer system can neatly be solved. Some in the ministry caution against the usage of significant quantities of nuclear material for effectively disposable engines, but given the cost of all of the other hardware the actual fissiles are expected to be relatively cheap. Work will focus on the construction of a low-thrust rocket for a theoretical RLA-3 nuclear stage as a unified bus for the transit of satellites to the outer planets and mercury. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Light Launcher Programs: With the conclusion of the development period for the RLA-1 and 3, a heavy and super heavy launcher is available to the Union, but nothing for lighter payloads. Starting dedicated development work on a lightweight launcher capable of hauling up to two tons into low earth orbit can significantly widen the capacity for light payloads and work off of military developments. The program itself will have to make the challenging decision between the re-utilization of kerosine parts from the RLA or military programs, but a combined system should be cheap with the wealth of experience from previous initiatives. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Station Program: With the availability of the RLA-3 for the launch of very heavy payloads, nothing prevents the development and launch of a forty-ton habitable module to orbit. The module will then be crewed through a conventional launch of the FGB-VA bus along with the transfer of experiments and technologies aboard. The development of a whole new spacecraft will take some time, but starting work towards the sustained habitation of space can enable further projects in low earth orbit and truly long-duration experiments. Current limitations in electrical and thermal systems will be the major limit on the duration of these integrated stations, but if the next decade can replicate the gains of the last ten years those will be blown past. (-25 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Mercury Exploration Program: Current techniques and probes are sufficient for the flyby of mercury, with the main limitation falling towards the boost stage. Due to the problematic orbit of mercury, an intercept requires a massive degree of velocity to even attempt. Combining an RLA-3 along with a newly developed enlarged interplanetary stage is one proposal for such a mission allowing for an easy capability expansion without new technical developments. The stage will use the same engines and same tankage techniques if significantly scaled up for increased capability. Orbiting mercury is beyond any developed rocket, but a theoretical nuclear engine may be able to fix that. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Increased Commercialization: Further emphasizing the necessity of enterprises along with options towards conventionally increasing space presence is essential for program funding. Current patents developed as a part of the program have been carefully handed out to several enterprises but a far wider approach can be taken, steadily politically moving the general space program to one more focused on general research instead of niche political achievements. The practical money spent on space development is unlikely to be returned to a large extent but it should provide further justifications for increasing spending. (1 Dice)

[]Intercosmos: Ensuring that anyone in CMEA can commission a payload or astronaut has delivered considerable victories but a general increase in both the scale and availability of the program can be started. It does not matter if it's a German or Soviet enterprise commissioning a payload for launch and it may as well be spread block-wide. The cheap costs of the RLA as production numbers have increased have steadily improved availability, allowing several smaller payloads to be launched at once. Some in the military have criticized the current program of international development, but as only civilian payloads are launched there are few practical issues. (1 Dice)


Light and Chemical Industry (10) 8 Dice

[]Caspian Sea Petrochemical Extraction(Stage 2/2): Pioneering new technologies and drilling rig designs can significantly improve the general petrochemical yields across the Union. Current work in the Caspian is focused on the development of fields in the middle of the sea that are currently challenging to access. New semi-submersible designs are expected to be made domestically and further developed so that harsher conditions can be braved for oil extraction, ideally eventually allowing the utilization of arctic basins. (150 Resources per Dice 45/150) (-28 CI5 Electricity -6 Petroleum Fuels +1 General Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Samotor Field Development(Stage 3/3): Continued conventional development of the massive Samotor field is a logical conclusion from previous programs. Local towns have already been moved into the area with continued development a logical conclusion from previous efforts. The oil in the region is of moderate density, allowing current cracking techniques to easily deal with it. Further theoretical development is also possible but there is only so much oil that can be drilled in a short term with further fields necessary for further improving production. (120 Resources per Dice 37/125) (-18 CI3 Electricity -6 Petroleum Fuels +1 General Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Air Conditioner Plants(Stage 5/8): The total modernization of Soviet housing for the next plan will not come without a strong push toward further investment. Climate control has significantly improved the perceived living standards of workers in the West and it can do the same here. Instead of apartments that get stuffy due to limited circulation a new universal standard with larger units can be adopted for the next generation of the housing program. Actual fourth-generation housing is not expected until the start of the next plan, but committing the preparatory work towards expanding production can more than ensure adequate development. (100 Resources per Dice 6/300) (-32 CI3 Electricity +1 Steel +2 Non-Ferrous +2 General Labor)

[]Modern Foods Production(Stage 3/3): Further efforts towards improving the production methodologies of new foods and increasing the market share of semi-durable goods can help to stimulate the economy. Many of the foods produced by the program are inherently far more stable than any that have come before, improving logistical supplies and providing a considerable return on investment. Distribution and the evaluation of new types of goods to be produced will take some time outside the establishment of factories, but there is almost no shortage of demand at the distributor level for stable goods. (85 Resources per Dice 1/200) (-21 CI3 Electricity +2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Consumer Goods Production Grants(Stage 2/2): With limitations in production and the necessity of further modernization rather than intensification the consumer grants program has been reformatted. Modernization of production methods and an increasing degree of labor assistance devices can be utilized to reduce the degree of personnel needed. Further work on increasing consumer production will have to be done taking note of strong limitations in labor but that can still be done. The program itself will effectively conclude after the current plan, transitioning to a more technical program in its entirety. (120 Resources per Dice 62/150) (-27 CI5 Electricity +4 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Light Home Appliance Plants: Electrical vacuum cleaners and a new generation of heavy appliances are needed to meet the expanding boom in apartments and the demand for more advanced goods. Production of further items has steadily increased in the last few years but by providing seed capital for more new companies an increase in availability and internal competition can induce a general drive towards product improvements. Founding almost a dozen smaller plants to produce specialty equipment and house tools necessary for daily tasks can serve to make the market more competitive and bring more engineers into the system. (130 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-21 CI5 Electricity +4 General Labor +1 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Second Generation Furnishings: Standardized and mass-produced furniture is well and good, but people have consistently pushed for more variety. By bringing in a few hundred designers and creating standard catalogs and styles with some collaboration of the private sector the general furniture production system can be modernized. Standardized styles can be consolidated and brought in from the private sector, taking reliable products and bringing them into primary circulation. Production and demand increases are sure to follow as a broader subset of industries are brought into the market and properly utilized. (100 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-12 CI4 Electricity +4 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Home Supplies Production: The development of supplies for private home renovation and general modernization has become a significant sector of private production. Introducing the state into the market and significantly increasing the supply of basic tools, materials, and parts can serve to increase private sector specialization. This will take some funding to break new enterprises into the sector and provide a more competitive landscape, but that can be done without too many issues. (120 Resources per Dice 0/100) (-16 CI4 Electricity +3 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Synthetic Rubber Plants(Stage 2/4): The demand for more rubber is massive and endemic across the whole economy. The recent spook with the Indonesian government turnover has left the rubber market struck with buy-ups and general increases in stockpiling, leaving prices rapidly spiraling up. Increasing production now will serve to provide a basis for many civilian industries and begin the direct breakaway from rubber import dependency while producing polymers more suited to the Union's climate. Synthetic production is not expected to overtake natural rubber unless massive funding is committed properly, but it needs to improve the quality of rubber and reduce the massive import dependency. (150 Resources per Dice 8/100) (-20 CI3 Electricity -5 Petrochemicals +1 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Virgin Lands Forestry: Nature must yield to the plan to continue industrial development. The forests across the Far East and Siberia have yet to be properly brought under utilization despite improving river traffic. Funding is set to go towards the area to significantly improve yields of lumber for both local construction and general production. Starting to increase settlement with cheap lumber will serve to improve populations and continue the drive toward the proper utilization of our resources. (110 Resources per Dice 0/75) (+2 General Labor)

[]Second Generation Plastics(Stage 3/3): Further work in high-hardness engineering plastics on top of German developments has a significant degree of promise. Using the more stable cross-polymer interactions of ketones the new compounds promise a notable improvement in both durability and chemical resistance. Large-scale production or universal applications are not expected due to the cost of even medium-scale production. Still, more specialty materials with unique material properties can significantly help defense and chemical industries.

[]Domestic Lithographic Equipment: The theoretical basis for a high-density circuit has been mostly designed from the ground up but far more funding is going to be needed to bring it to a large scale. Combined efforts towards the entirely domestic production of new lithography equipment along with further developments will effectively be the priority. Simultaneously better understood work on the creation of high purity silicon for use in the production of wafer blanks. Ideally, once the project runs its full course a series of three dedicated fabs capable of working on 75mm wafers at a ten micrometer feature size will be constructed. Achieving higher yields and greater transistor density than any previous theoretical projects by the end of the next plan. (240 Resources per Dice 0/125) (-42 CI6 Electricity +2 Educated Labor)


Agriculture (6) 6 Dice

[]Domestic Meat Programs(Stage 4/10): Increasing the density of chicken production while animal stocks are steadily increased for further efforts. Continued improvements in sourcing and efficiency of feeds along with the steady gains in weight per hen are expected to steadily improve the efficiency of the entire meat sector. Funding is still necessary to ensure that the average Soviet worker can eat chicken every day, but with every step of the program that approaches ever closer. Drives towards improved feeds for improving the rate of bird survival and more advanced veterinary sciences have already improved yields. By expanding the general industry and standardizing them, further gains can be made. (105 Resources per Dice 12/250) (-26 CI1 Electricity +2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Increasing Mechanization: Tractors and their attachments are needed now more than ever as field sizes per laborer have grown as quickly as production has. Work towards ensuring that manual labor is finally eliminated from common-form crops must be continued to mobilize the average worker and ensure that development can continue. A modern tractor is worth more than an agricultural laborer and every small farmer should have a basic mechanical understanding of their machines along with the machine itself. Forming a large educational program offering discounts and subsidies for equipment purchases for family farms can improve mechanization without much risk. (100 Resources per Dice 161/200)

[]Water and Waste Grants: Accepting that the small towns may independently raise at least some of the money for the development of services is an open question, but many can be helped along. Offering a community-level investment program for towns above a thousand people to subsidize the cost of modernization can significantly improve services. Yield gains are not expected from running new lines of sewage and water, but those can serve to keep labor on hand and at least avoid actively repulsing educated agronomists. (110 Resources per Dice 0/100)

[]Payments for Land Diversion: If control over planting is going to be delegated out to the farms, mechanisms to still produce desired outcomes can be implemented through the market system. Effectively paying farmers to keep a portion of fields fallow and rotated out while avoiding massive intensification of chemical products can provide some easy returns. This will cost the state money and be a further handout to the enterprises but at least land management outcomes can be improved. (140 Resources per Dice 0/125)

[]Topsoil Preservation Programs: State intervention and standards for the management of soils and the preservation of their integrity have been suggested to maintain yields and improve the agricultural system. Effectively this will come as an effort towards the management of groundside winds and ensuring that stabilizing crops are planted in regions with significant arid periods. Planting efforts are in themselves expected to be a major labor program for any local workers in more remote areas, beautifying local areas with covers of trees and maintaining a degree of shade on most roads.

Services (16) 10 Dice

[]Expanded Childcare(Stage 4/6): Continuing the drive towards improving lower-level education and constructing state infrastructure for childcare has had a curious effect of increasing workforce participation for both men and women. The latter was expected, but with the burden of children carried more by the state the previous necessity of a relative or parent at home has been reduced to a manageable extent for most couples. Continued work in the field is expected to focus on improving educational outcomes, but expansion will come as a part of it to make it a more accessible and universal service. (70 Resources per Dice 14/250) (-7CI2 Electricity +2 General Labor) (Increase in Workforce Participation)

[]Transportation Enterprises(Stage 3/5): Continuing the large-scale drive towards improving the transportation industry will be essential for continuing economic development. Previous programs have considerably improved transportation, reducing overall prices and stimulating the private sector. Increasing the scope of the program and integrating it with a general stores program can provide further improvements of transportation capacity all at the cost of founding some small enterprises. Continued truck imports are going to be needed to keep pace, but the funding exists to more than complete the program.

[]Technical Training Programs: Committing educated personnel to improved training programs to enable the continued modernization of towns is expected to be essential. Current inadequacies and rural lack of employment have significantly reduced the impact of some programs but this can be to an extent fixed. Funding dedicated training and technical education programs for rural workers will take consistent expenditure of money and will not be popular, but that can be compensated for by working with enterprises. Effectively this program will be a logical extension of the labor reserve education system, expanding it considerably. (90 Resources per Dice 0/200) (-10 CI2 Electricity +2 Educated Labor)

[]Expanding Preparation Schools: Those going into university from a suboptimal educational background or general tracks have only steadily expanded in recent years. With the pressure to improve education, the question of sufficient preparation for entrance exams is pertinent and essential for improving student achievement. Taking over partially from the private sector several programs in mathematics and sciences can be started to allow more motivated students to improve their educations and compensate for poor previous performance in placements. The majority of institutions will run on the weekends and during the summer, providing opportunities and reducing scheduling conflicts.

[]Development of Population Services: The rural workers have considerably been under-served by developments in population services and that to an extent can be reversed. Funding for the location of minor legal offices and several more bureaucratic services can be provided to enable the coverage of small towns. Local transportation capability is still severely limited restricting the efficiency of both construction and coverage but it must be done to provide basic services. Transportation and telephone integration is expected to somewhat compensate for lower density but that has left the program expensive and arguably inefficient. (100 Resources per Dice 0/275) (-9 CI2 Electricity +3 Educated Labor)

[]Expansion of the Store System: Continued work on the distribution system has revealed several moderate weaknesses in reach towards smaller towns. They have generally remained the domain of smaller private grocers with some supply line inefficiencies and few opportunities for further logistical integration. Directly working with smaller grocers and creating supply-centric enterprises capable of providing them with standardized products can significantly improve outcomes and reduce prices. (80 Resources per Dice 0/150) (+2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Town-Market Construction: Building up specialized stores for services towards the smallest towns represents a previously unconsidered logistical challenge. Local forms of production are still significant with the movement of goods limited by the lack of roads and density. Continued funding work can start towards increasing access to goods through subsidizing small retailers in a state-run model. Most will sell gasoline, diesel, and a few basic goods but that in itself will significantly improve commerce. Increased accessibility will allow money to be spent locally, boosting development. (90 Resources per Dice 0/150) (+2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Localized Transport Services: The development of localized bus networks has been deprioritized due to the state of roads but that can be more than fixed. Committing a massive quantity of funding towards establishing regional and local bus lines to enable low-density commuting is an essential priority. Effective transportation to and from most remote villages will be the priority along with some expansions in local transit. For smaller locations, just a single looping route will be established but for those approaching the size of a city, a fully interconnected system can be made. The actual buses will only cover the fares cost with some loss expected but economically stimulating effects will more than compensate. (110 Resources per Dice 0/250) (+2 Petroleum Fuels +2 General Labor)

[]State Insurance Enterprises: Letting the state get involved in insurance distribution rather than the private sector can significantly help to reduce profit chasing and offer a steady minimal policy rather than wild variance. Across several important and high-risk industries, a general insurance scheme conducted through state-owned non-profit-seeking enterprises can be made to shoulder the worst risks, allowing businesses and enterprises to turn to the state for a comprehensive minimal plan. Assessment of risks will require the hiring of expertise and significant training programs, but there is no reason that the Union cannot have a domestic insurance industry.

Bureaucracy (8) 6 Dice (Supsov Selections marked by (Supreme Soviet))

[]Legal Enforcement: With the upcoming election year enforcing the law in full and concluding past efforts is almost certain to be popular. With control of the Ministry of Labor enforcement against the enterprises can be expanded to a significant extent, reducing the impact of bad managerial practices. Further work on enhancing the work environment will have to come after the election as there is only so much that can be passed in a single legislative session. The laws that are already made are sufficient, they only need to be enforced and depoliticized to reduce the impact of connections in the apparatus. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet)

[]Formalization of Hiring Practices: The conditions under which a worker could be fired have been effectively delegated to the enterprises under Mikoyan with policies maintained to a similar effect. Rather than allowing this system of interpretation to continue to exist, standards for what it takes to fire an employee need to be formalized. Arbitrary firing will be cracked down upon with it only available in conditions of financial distress. Legitimate firings can still be conducted if a trained replacement is available and willing to work or worker inadequacies but limiting churn to those should reduce some of the inconsistency in the labor market. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet)

[]Dedicate Focus Towards a Project(): (1 Bureau Dice for +5 per dice on a project, +15 in services) (Unrolled)

[]Authorize Farmer-Programs: Farmer aid has been dogmatically fought against either out of some ideal that large enterprises represent technocratic efficiency or out of some outdated ingrained dislike of the "peasantry." Ensuring that general urban aid social programs apply to the rural workers will take a considerable political effort with very few set to champion their cause, but it is the right thing to do in the current context and the Supreme Soviet is unlikely to react too poorly from a low commitment attempt to push it through. (1 Dice)

[]Rework the Agricultural Tax Code: With the shift away from taxing by land and towards taxes being placed on agricultural production some further changes can be made towards optimizing utilization. Land taxes based on valuation can be introduced along with a reform towards direct income taxes, saving most farmers some money and enabling continued growth. As long as the land itself is developed the development can be counted against the land taxes to a certain extent, especially for smaller farmers, encouraging the rapid modernization of methodologies. (1 Dice)

[]Back Comprehensive Tax Reform: Backing a total tax reform towards a significantly more tiered system with a series of further tax brackets is almost certainly not required for it to pass, but given the scale of legislation providing some backing can have concrete advantages. Both Kosygin and Romanov have worked together towards crafting it, leaving the question practically decided with few capable of disagreeing. Providing formal ministry backing will speed the passage and ensure that both have a favorable impression of the ministry, especially if the passage is accelerated sufficiently to occur before the election. (1 Dice) (Possible Favor)

[]Expanded Education for Adults: Night-time education has educated millions of workers since the revolution, but it can go a step further. Opening labor reserve education programs to any that want to come and pushing it as a system of education and work training can yield massive returns. Training workers is a challenge for several enterprises due to poorly organized bureaucratic overhead, but that can be fixed. By allowing workers to go into specialized education, those who perform acceptably can be slotted into a job on contract. The system is not going to be widely used in all likelihood, but even something basic towards improving the number of skilled workers can go a long way. (1 Dice)

[]Scientific Exchange Programs: Formalizing large-scale study and student programs to analyze foreign farming practices can improve domestic experiences and transfer new techniques. Much of what is learned will be more of an academic curiosity than useful information, but any improvement that can be made is an improvement. Borrowing techniques aren't expected to walk over any toes, as even the capitalists have not trademarked any methodologies. Expertise transfer is not expected to remotely work during this plan, but it can help in the next plan. (1 Dice)

[]Formalize Patent Purchases: Import of patents on a state level for internal distribution remains a challenging question and has so far primarily been done at the enterprise level. Centralizing efforts towards the purchase and licensing of technologies for the establishment of new enterprises can return significant gains. The formal organization for the job will be made through Romanov rather than the ministry but control should be mostly divided. Continued technical imports are still likely to be needed as the technical potential of the Union has yet to truly exceed that of the West no matter the proclamations of the optimistic. (1 Dice)

[]Intellectual Capital Exports to CMEA: Allowing a further degree of licensing of the state patent databases to nations that closely work with the Union in CMEA will significantly improve economic performance. The currently accumulated patents represent a massive investment in education and a key resource. Some on the more conservative end of the party have argued against degrading domestic competitiveness, but if the block is to function some concessions must be provided. Kosygin himself is almost certain to back the program and may consider it as a logical step towards further integration with Eastern Europe. (1 Dice)

[]Tariff Compensation: Setting degrees of imports that occur under tariffs and providing a means of compensating farmers for exporting through foreign tariffs can buy some popularity and ensure deeper sector penetration. Some economies have consistently decided to hold off the proliferation of cheaper foods due to a protectionist drive, but that can be overcome without too many issues. Foreign capital for domestic production, even if it is inefficient, can achieve significant external political victories. Domestically ensuring that farmers have fewer issues with foreign markets can stabilize prices and ensure that disruptions are compensated for. (1 Dice)

[]Expand Student Recruitment: Students have been reliable and mostly not questionable in politics. They are young and believe that the world ahead of them is theirs to seize, but that does not make them inherently idiotic incompetent, or merely inexperienced. Allowing a further selection of positions centered around training for more senior ministry posts and formalizing some of the in-department succession can have good returns for practically little cost. The ministry needs a constant and consistent supply of trained personnel and there is little reason to restrict it. (1 Dice) (Options to trade dice bonus for dice next plan vote)

[]Intervene on Social Legislation: The various progressive wings are trying to progress the Union off a social cliff by trying to chase the unrealistic and impractical ideas of the West. There is no reason to embrace tendencies towards degeneracy or to inhibit the independent potential of workers through maneuvers in social policy. Standing ably with Romanov protecting the Soviet people against strange concepts outside the norm and ensuring that the party stays stable is far more important. A good number of the causes pushed will still get through but the mere act alone should serve to signal a solid conservative commitment. (1 Dice)

[]Intervene on Labor Policy: Labor policy allowances by Romanov have not been bad in the strictest sense but far more can be done to force a compromise between the workers and the enterprises. Increasing the import of unskilled labor is not going to be popular but it needs to be done to keep costs low and allow for continued development. Restrictions towards ensuring imported labor can only take on work that Soviet workers are unwilling or unable to do will be implemented concurrently increasing immigration while further protecting the worker. (1 Dice)

[]Directly Campaign(Select number of dice 1-4): Formally standing for the general position of Romanov's faction and directly working with him to the extent of touring the local party organs can ensure a degree of balance. Work on other tasks will be directly damaged by moving away from Moscow but the most important party organs must be encouraged and properly assessed. To an extent anything outside a fast airborne tour is going to rapidly hit diminishing returns but local encouragement for a set of party ministers that do not see anyone at all from Moscow can have its benefits. (1-4 Dice)

[]Reorganize a Department(Choose Department): There still exist massive bureaucratic holes in the apparatus between the limitations in the heavy industrial sector and the pile of idiots left from previous struggles. The current head of services is effectively useless for making forward progress and there is not a shortage of important but replaceable idiots. While the Union is in the throes of massive reorganization the chance can be taken to put in more appropriate ministers for a plan. (1 Dice)


Current Economic Prices(Domestic/CMEA/International): (How this will work is that every action above except for electricity modifies the internal price of the commodities below. They also vary on their own and are sorted into abstracted 1-100 ranges. Modifiers from the rest of your economy are displayed below with each category of goods. When you shift between 20-sized ranges, there can be significant modifiers to the general economy that come from changing prices of core commodities. CMEA prices determine the price in CMEA, though transportation of goods will be a problem with international prices representative of the West.)

Plan Effects:

Housing Construction Efforts: Given the sheer disruption caused by the last housing program and the extent of change it has forced onto people without much desire for it, cutting it back is arguably the best political decision. A well-run program without the sheer tempo and idiocy of the Voznesensky years will inherently be slower and require a more measured and distributed pace of development rather than a drive towards urban concentration. Most of the designs prioritized will be cheaper and smaller ones relative to the massive towers prioritized in the last effort, reducing some costs and ensuring that lower-density urban concentrations can be maintained. (-3 Infra Dice -360 RpY Modified by Steel Prices) (Reduction in Communal and Barracks Housing Forms to 9% of the adult non-student population by 1970)

Amur Cascade: The political sensitivity of the Amur River and its tributaries is immense. Development in the region is important for local power supplies and further industrial development. Daming the actual Amur is too much of an international political situation to ever allow, the rivers feeding into it however are almost entirely on our side of the border. Their damming will involve a degree of moderate relocations as small towns are consolidated through the small scale and will keep the costs down. Localization of a significant aluminum industry from secondary sources is expected to provide a good supply of material to local factories, and the stabilization of the river system is expected to provide a viable route for exports.

Amu Darya and Syr Danya Hydroelectric Cascades: Politically contentious with the local people though pushed for hydrological stabilization by engineers and politicians at all levels, authorizing development is expected to significantly increase water accessibility and local energy generation. The program towards constructing new dams and enhancing the industrial development of the Central Asian republics is expected to fix water availability issues and provide a cheap basis for hydroelectricity that has been ignored by past administrations. Relocations will involve several sizable towns being moved to allow for the path of the dams and a minor cutback in the scale of the project. Despite that though, the developing water situation is only expected to worsen in the next few years, requiring redirection and ensuring that nature is finally directed towards humanist ends.

Power Plant Construction(Nuclear VVER-500): A commitment to new experimental technologies is significant and could be an important source of power in the future, but it is currently deeply uneconomic. The construction of sixteen mainline reactor cores along with two experimental cores will establish a basis for energy production and the development of the fast neutron spectrum. The cores themselves are expected to steadily take off the burden of conventional heating and provide the associated cities with clean nuclear heating and energy. Construction is to be finalized across the next plan, as the technical aspects of the construction are notable and each general multi-core facility is in itself a complicated system of both piping and construction. (-1 HI Dice -300 RpY) (36 Electricity +1 Coal per Year 1970-1975)

Power Plant Construction(CPSC): Large increases in coal power generation are needed to keep the Union supplied with power. The gas industry is capable of supplying some but with a strong commitment towards expanding canal works and several large-scale coking plants to take advantage of the high carbon and low ash sub-bituminous coals in the East. Conventional expansions of coal extraction from Kuzbas are expected to reduce the cost of coal and make coal power production the predominant form of cheap and accessible energy across the Union. (-2 HI Dice -480 RpY) (140 Electricity +5 Coal per Year)

Power Plant Construction(CCGT): A direct drive towards increasing power production is expected to be necessary with the growth of consumer and industrial power use, especially as the economy continues its march towards modernization. Increased utilization of gas reserves and a continuation of the old power program will deliver significant gains in production and enable a considerable step forward. The plants responsible for making the turbines will not need to be expanded compared to the last plan, especially since much of the challenging and technical work has been completed. (-2 LCI Dice -560 RpY) (160 Electricity per Year) (3 More Gas development projects)

Healthcare Expansion: A massive expansion and making sure that every citizen can have access to some form of healthcare, even if it is not the best quality, will do a lot to improve health outcomes. There are plenty of younger inexperienced general-purpose doctors graduating from the education system that are suitable to be distributed as a first line for emergency medicine. The funding will mostly go towards the building of a few standardized clinics with a few beds and a capacity to address mild general cases along with building up transportation infrastructure for transportation. Modernization of the system will have to be delayed due to a lack of capacity as saving people is more important than more accurate diagnostics. (-2 Services Dice -240 RpY) (Completes up to Stage 9 Healthcare Expansion)

Education Expansion: Unfucking the university and education system in the aftermath of the massive over-emphasis on technical education will take more time than is available in the current plan. The sector is comparatively mature with the few professors needed to teach classes effectively experienced and already publishing research. The planned extension of the secondary education system can be conducted along with the main focus of the modernization effort. A massive expansion of the university system is to be conducted with social science departments added to most schools along with several dedicated specialized schools established in the old model. Enough personnel that have the soft skills for most work will take decades to bring up. In decades though they will exist rather than the current endless supply of engineers.
