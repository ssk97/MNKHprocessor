Internal Politics:

Consolidation of left wing activities has come with the effective unelectability of Ashimov. In a rare acceptance of physical reality the far left have steadily realized that running on a platform of just radicalism and change without substance or capacity to affect anything of relevance. Immediate splits between Evgeny Mikhailovich Tyazhelnikov and the remainder of the Ashimovite core have vastly destabilized the faction in the leadup towards the election. The former advocates for a more reasonable path towards socialism, focusing on a revisionist interpretation of marxist theory instead of a sufficient amount of delusion. Debates between the two on the left have had Tyazhelnikov take advantage of Ashimov's near certain disgrace and broadly secure imperfect authority over the block, even if a significant number of delegates have been left uncertain and poorly directed.

More acutely the exclusion of Zimyanin from any semblance of overall factional administration has led to vast instabilities and significant opportunities. Pivoting from a man that could be undoubtedly expected to preach a somewhat more radical version of Stalin's writings to a more flexible stance has immense potential to win over more conservative voices as long as Vorotnikov's weakness continues. The faction itself can broadly be broken down into four discrete camps: left-communists, stalinists, conservatives, and technocrats with the latter even remotely loyal to the current course of matters. Agitation by a slighted Zimyanin is unlikely to affect much change but his presence leaves the greatest acute risk of a backstab by the more Stalinist elements. At this point the faction must succeed in order to stabilize politics and secure enough of a majority as both Vorotnikov and Ryzhkov have little patience for the ministry, even if both are currently too mired in matters to move on it.

Weakness in the conservative center has come down to a perception of inability relative to the relentless advance of Ryzhkov in institutions of state power. Vorotnikov himself is increasingly seen as outflanked in the arrangement as the party has taken a more secondary role to state institutions. Participants in the supreme soviet at least somewhat loyal to him have moved to refute the point but the limitations placed by Ryzhkov have undermined even that. Conversely on the right wing the strong resurgence of the far right has brought significant instability as attacks on Ryzhkov have somewhat followed the same theme. Irrelevant oppositional attacks from the right have caused it to increasingly consolidate, aiming to seize power from its current height instead of dealing with what is increasingly seen as historical baggage.

Consolidating from Gulyam as something of his protege, Anatoly Panteleevich Dumachev has moved to modernize the position of the far right, departing somewhat from the faction's more managerial roots. Mistakenly advanced by Voznesensky as a part of a more general technocratic drive to mobilize party cadres in Leningrad, he has now taken a somewhat more adaptive line in the light of Soviet Politics. Rather than shifting the party significantly, he has instead advocated for the exclusive "modernization" of the economic system, enabling enterprises to partially privatize outside of the most essential sectors. Further, as a means of technocratic improvement, he advocates for the role of the state to switch towards the ultimate enforcer in the context of a market system, optimizing it and guiding it towards desirable ends while allowing for autonomous optimization. With a weakening conservative faction, his marginally more practical line represents a political danger that Gulyam's insanity never had.


Military Equipment Part 3(Navy):

Continued deep modernizations of the Soviet Navy have centered around the vast quantity of new equipment made available through development programs. Integrated circuit based systems have arrived in a major way with onboard system refits to enhance the potential of the technology to revolutionize every aspect of warfare. Digitalization drives have somewhat lagged behind the American examples of similar systems but domestic production of sufficient numbers of chips has enabled somewhat profligate spending across naval systems. Improvements in manufacturing from the same approaches has also led to gains in performance, especially in the submarine fleet with older vessels starting to enter considerations for retirement. There is little reason to maintain the old loud boats when radical improvements are both available and affordable, expanding striking power outside of bastion zones.

Modernizations for the 633 and 641 classes of submarines have been limited to the replacement of torpedoes to modern monopropellant dual purpose systems. UGST torpedoes alone are expected to significantly increase the striking power of the now somewhat obsolescent boats with the addition of limited onboard modernizations in effect only there to enable their use. Continued service from both classes is expected into the mid 1980s as new submarine strength will not be available to replace them, but with the increase in American defense spending there is no practical way to retire the classes. A towed array upgrade has further been proposed but been rejected, citing the necessity of new advanced components for more viable submarines.

Construction and introduction into service of the 877 class has started, in effect obsoleting all older diesel electric submarines through significant capacity auditions. Quieter than any of the nuclear boats as long as the boats operate on electric power alongside a far greater degree of damping, the class is expected to replace all older diesel vessels. The largest improvement on the boat is through the improvement of passive sensors with a wide angle frontal array paired with an extended deployable array to improve acoustic listening. Onboard weapons are a combination of 20 UGST, RPK-6, or RK-55. Practical payloads are expected to consist mostly of UGST torpedoes with a light missile armament outside of dedicated strike roles. Automation onboard is expected to reduce the crew to just fifty six men, but the three and a half thousand ton boat has been designed somewhat conservatively in all respects for export performance.

Development on the primary strike arm of the fleet has come down to a series of compromises and significant advances in missile development. Solid state electronic networking on a missile platform is in itself immensely ambitious with the next generation submarine launched system practically requiring it given the advancing state of American defenses around carrier groups. Vastly improved quieting and ELF datalinks are expected to provide the targeting information for the new 949's enabling them to use satellites as a means of targeting vast missile strikes. Cross-boat coordination is somewhat limited, but strike formation from multiple submarines can be somewhat achieved with the new P-700 platform. With an effective range of 600 km alongside a nearly mach two high agility terminal phase alongside far more advanced homing, the advantage is expected to shift towards missile strikes, at least until networked defensive systems proliferate. Construction plans currently call for 24 boats to be built over the next decade, greatly enhancing primary strike power outside of bastion zones for the entire fleet.

Rationalization of production submarines has seen a focus fall towards a third generation variation of a base 667 hull, bringing it to an approximate standard expected of far heavier naval systems. Unification of the power system into a unitary 180MWt core has ensured parts commonality on the fleet alongside improvements in the propulsion section. Modifications to hull materials have increased diving depths on the new class while entirely precision machined internal components with heavy dampening have brought the class to an entirely new standard of stealth. Two stage R-29RK missiles are expected to be fit to all 667 BDR and new construction 667 BDRM boats, bringing strike power to parity with American systems with each boat carrying 16x6 150kt re-entry vehicles capable of ranging out to 7000 km. Improvements in digital guidance systems have only somewhat managed to improve precision to 500m CEP, but that is currently believed to be adequate for most operational missions.

Production of the first true submarine of the third generation has come with a consolidation of best-design elements from the 945, 685 and 705D programs into the 971. High automation is expected to significantly reduce crew sections and crew requirements while an advanced CNC machined hull with heavy damping is expected to radically reduce sound emissions. All solid state fire control systems have been designed with data-integration across the frontal array, integral side arrays, and towed array. The two most significant gains on the boats come down to the onboard sensor fusion alongside vastly improved quieting born from the availability of advanced machine tooling on an otherwise somewhat inexpensive steel hull relative to its precursors. Propulsion power is provided by a modular 200MWt core that can be replaced for refueling driving a multi stage pump-jet encased screw for enhanced maneuverability. Unification of the high maneuver concept boats with a general purpose mobilization design has rendered all first and early second generation boats obsolete, forcing an increased funding towards production.

Onboard weapon systems are entirely consolidated across six automatically loaded tubes, capable of firing UGST, RPK-6, or RK-55s in a mixed fashion alongside submarine simulator decoys. The UGST is in itself a massive improvement over the SET-65 and TEST-71M in all respects, integrating a solid state passive-active sonar system, increased depth keeping, 30km wire, and very high speed terminal profile. The universal torpedo is going to be prioritized for the newer boats as production is still limited, but it is expected to come to all but the oldest diesel electrics over the next decade. RPK-6 systems are a direct parallel to surface based URPK-5 modernizations of the Metel complex, enabling submarines to rapidly engage sub surface targets through missile deployed weapons. The RK-55 is in itself a platform for conducting deep strikes on convoys rather than direct warship targets, firing a low sea skimming subsonic extreme range missile for naval strikes and fires on known convoy positions. Decoy development has started somewhat behind American efforts but serviceable units are expected to reach the fleet by 1985.

Mature gun systems have finally been issued to the fleet with previous development programs offering direct and significant returns. The base AK-130-2 platform has received significant modernization with an engagement sustained 90 RPM rate of fire alongside high specificity targeting radar for engagements against sea skimming missiles. AK-100 mounts have been somewhat deprioritized for development, unifying onto a 130mm single barrel capable of sustaining 60 RPM through enhanced cooling. Lighter end systems have shifted towards rate of fire with a light AK-176 developed to augment lighter craft with outer-envelope anti missile systems. The new gun integrates a full independent TV track, allowing for engagements against any sea skimming profile while continuously delivering 120 RPM. Mountings for the system are expected to be somewhat universal, replacing all older dual 57mm weapons with a single integral gun-system.

Airborne centric development of an effective low cost strike platform that can be carried by Mig-23MKs has rapidly driven improvements in capabilities. Somewhat following the entry into service of the French Exocet, the domestic Kh-35/P-35 system has started entry into service. A somewhat heavier 740/620kg platform with and without booster, the range improvements of the system enable its use at 120km of range. Low sea skimming integration is core to the program alongside a mach 0.8 surface level cruise so as to provide some means of defensive penetration. Guidance onboard is if anything unsophisticated, allowing a limited data link back to the launch aircraft but without the advanced modes of heavier ordinance. Light missiles are expected to provide a significant cost savings and enable mixed loadout strikes, driving their adoption as the primary strike arm of the carrier fleet relative to older Kh-15 based systems. Adoption of the new missile is only expected to start in two years with most lighter ships receiving priority for new production as P-15 launchers are replaced with a triplex P-35 modification kit.

Improvements onto the P-500 system have come somewhat slower compared to the advancements elsewhere. Direct modernization of the seeker is expected to significantly improve performance against most targets, but the missile bus itself is limited in a number of respects. A combination of a high range profile alongside significant thermal stress placed on the missile has in effect avoided easy modernization potential even if the platform is expected to be mounted as something of a standard heavy anti-shipping missile. Sea-skimming mach two attack modes on a missile with a 600 km range is still expected to achieve significant penetrations of hostile defense envelopes but a more modern third generation missile is necessary to unify past programs and provide a superior platform. Lightning from improved electronics alone represents a significant potential for modernization alongside more advanced ramjets, but a new missile is required to realize the potential.

With the availability of new missile systems and the effective obsolescence of the P-15 in all naval strike roles outside of strikes on poorly protected heavy shipping, refits of the 1241 class have been authorized. Replacing the old P-15 launchers with triplex P-35s has extended operational capabilities and saved some weight, enabling a general hardware modernization to be conducted alongside the general modernization of the vessel. Lacking production of new AK-176 systems have somewhat delayed the most modern variant from entering service, but that is expected to be corrected over time as the gun is made available. New production models are steadily expected to replace the oldest missile corvettes in service with all 122 and 204 class vessels expected to be sold off or scrapped by 1995. Comparative ASW capability modernization has been accompanied by a larger order of vessels, if ones that have not yet received a true modern solid state sonar system due to production deficiencies and deprioritization of technical design capabilities.

The most significant technical modernizations have come onto the next generation 1135 class frigates, expanding design tonnage by 200 tons to significantly augment onboard electronic systems. Prioritization of new equipment alongside lightening measures has produced a vastly more capable vessel, if one with a partially reduced direct strike role. Networked radar systems onboard with a central processing computer have enabled the ship to engage up to sixteen targets, including anti-sea skimming capabilities for the first time. Unification of anti-submarine warfare onto a conventional torpedo based platform capable of launching either a UGST with limited wire, RPK-2, or eventually RPK-6 have largely replaced the Metis complex on new construction vessels, standardizing fleet wide aramment. A deployable towed array and helipad rounding out the ASW capability, even if the design is lacking in a helicopter hanger due to the prioritization of escort capabilities.

To unify fleet assets into a single modern class of destroyer the 956 program has reached fruition, incorporating improved technologies, digital fire control, and a universal weapon system. Initial expectations for a P-120 armament have proven somewhat obsolete with the weapon system replaced by P-35's in a four by eight mounting, incorporating onboard trajectory calculation and thrust regime settings to enable automatic time on target strikes. System limitations outside the 956 and 1135 classes render the system as an idealized time for launch calculator, but even that can provide significant advantages in overcoming layered defenses. Gun armament has consolidated on two AK-130s and four AK-630s providing a reasonable scope of close-in defenses, if one that is considered light for the eight thousand ton vessel. Anti submarine armament is somewhat consolidated relative to previous classes of more specialized destroyers, only featuring a single helicopter with a hanger alongside two twinned torpedo tubes capable of firing all standard ASW ordinance.

Most significantly for the 956 class, the mounting of the all new S-300F solid state multilayered air-defense complex, breaking with the previous standards for all air defense systems. Mounted as a mixture of six nine shot heavy-missile cassettes alongside forty light missiles in quadruple cassette blocks, the system represents a leap forward in anti-missile capabilities with strong distinction of clutter and a high simultaneous target engagement capability. Cross ship networking for anti-aircraft tasks is limited outside of track coordination, but the system still represents a radical shift in naval anti-aircraft and anti-missile capabilities. Guidance of several interceptors alongside the use of phased arrays promises to largely eliminate the weaknesses inherent to older systems, obsoleting them and providing the fleet with a modern anti-aircraft screen.

Development and construction of the 1164 has followed original planning with the original project only replacing the Buk with the S-300F complex entirely. Combined anti-aircraft armament onboard is identical to the lighter 956 with the 1164 losing the AK-130-2 on the aft and replacing it with a helicopter hanger containing two reserve helicopters alongside the one on the pad. Anti shipping armament is entirely centered on the P-500 complex, mounting eight twin launchers to provide adequate firepower in most general fleet engagements without significant air participation. The onboard antisubmarine complex has been reduced to two sets of triple torpedo tubes, providing the ability to fire all current modern ordinance. Overall the ship is the heavy-strike component outside of carrier employment, if somewhat of a dead end in a tactical role given the current state of the fleet.

The carrier program has increasingly focused on the modernization and expansion of the modern air arm as the old carriers have proven too limited for most operational tasks. Modernization of the ninety four thousand ton Volga class design has emphasized the replacement of the entire air defense complex with a series of ten nine missile VLS pods alongside one hundred twenty light missiles on a twinned complex with each half of direction control guiding half of the onboard ordinance. Two AK-630s have been replaced with AK-176 guns with the remainder maintained as an independent system for the neutralization of hostile ordinance. More compact storage methods for the Mig-23MKs have raised onboard wings to a standard of sixty plane strike elements augmented by eight helicopters and eight Yak-44 AEW craft. With expanding funding for the fleet, it is expected to be in continuous production for the entire next decade as the first six ships have been authorized and funded as follow-on construction is expected to replace the obsolete Moscow and Kharkov classes in the 90s.

To support amphibious operations and enhance amphibious capabilities a modern landing ship class has been designed, entering production to aid in power projection. The vessel itself is somewhat conventional with a central cavity designed to carry and land an armored company as a design goal. The 775 class integrates some supporting fires, having a AK-130-2 and two AK-176s as primary armament augmented by two AK-630s to serve as missile defense. Onboard surface to air is limited to dual purpose ammunition and two twin boom Osa systems for limited area defense as a part of operations. Sustained speeds of eighteen knots have been judged as sufficient, leaving the class capable of most reasonable landing operations. Planned construction of the series has been strongly funded with a total of thirty eight vessels funded to provide the fleet with modern landing capabilities.

Development of somewhat intermediary anti aircraft systems has received significant cutbacks in funding relative to more advanced combination solid-state systems pioneered by Almaz and expected to take on both medium and long range defensive roles. The less advanced Osa has received much of the emphasis as lacking miniaturization capabilities of more advanced electronics alongside the advantages of an all-in-one package for naval mounts has favored it over the Buk. This nonetheless has not fixed the technical problems of a lightweight command guided missile meant to use a light radar set for single channel guidance. Its theoretically improved envelope modifications against sea skimming ordinance and inbuilt ECCM capabilities are notable, but insufficient to provide an advantage on newly built platforms. Army use is somewhat more notable for the complex as a single light radar guided air defense platform can serve as a lower echelon defense.

Combined programs on the S-300 system have in effect revolutionized most aspects of anti-aircraft warfare through the use of a networked multi-layered system capable of dealing with both close and far interceptions. Improved naval systems have been able to achieve a networked continuous engagement of eight targets with up to twenty four of missiles in the air under inertial guidance profiles for longer range engagements. Reliable radar tracks for the newer semi-active terminal seeker have lowered effective engagement horizons to approximately six meters with reducing capabilities down to even lower altitudes. The largest development of the program has been an all-phased array antenna system, capable of inter-comparison of highly cluttered tracks to distinguish them and somewhat eliminate the resistance posed by low altitude clutter. The solid state electronic system that serves as the brain of the unit is in itself a practical supercomputer with production of new systems sharply limited, but expected to steadily distribute across the fleet to reduce the threat of superior American sea skimming missiles.

Missiles for the new system are a dual layer system taking advantage of two discrete systems so as to provide more capable point defense and long range fires. On the heavier end the all solid fuel container stored 1480 kg 5K55F is to be used as the basis for long range fires with a one hundred kilometer range and a far more advanced combined triplex semi-active/Track via-missile/inertial guidance scheme capable of distinguishing against ground clutter. The accompanying lighter 440kg 9M48 instead incorporates a simpler dual seeker with crude guidance achieved by TVM before final interception is achieved through mixed guidance with a sensitive high contrast infrared seeker. Modularity in modes alongside improved storage conditions for both missiles have rendered the far more advanced system not significantly more expensive relative to liquid fueled older missiles, and a replacement for nearly all warships heavy enough to equip dedicated anti-aircraft and missile systems.

Infrastructure: (18) 9 Dice

[]Western Local Roads(Stage 2/3): Western road developments have started but still vastly lag behind even the most rudimentary expectations of a developed nation. Previous programs to close the gap have emphasized the development of most throughput limited infrastructure but measures must be taken towards expanding the general state of development. Current programs aim at increasing the local fraction of paved roads alongside standardizing the use of two lane paved roads in significantly traversed areas around major urban centers. Continued funding will emphasize the modernization of the countryside so as to increase the development of industries as the immediate political concerns can be minimized. (150 Resources per Dice 132/400)

[]Caucuses Local Roads(Stage 1/2): Negligent construction practices have strongly undermined regional infrastructure and avoided the implementation of more productive means of transport. Through intensive programs involving the paving of tens of thousands of kilometers of mountain roads alongside general modernization programs, local infrastructure can be brought up to standards appropriate for the post-war era. The current situation is decidedly inadequate and even the proposed changes are marginal compared to the significant demand for roads experienced by smaller rural and urban communities. (160 Resources per Dice 0/175)

[]Ural Region Local Roads(Stage 1/2): Lack of stable terrain due to freeze thaw cycles, lack of technological confidence, and a lack of general will to construct local roads have significantly undermined regional economic activity. Strong growth is dependent on the increase in extent of local urban and rural infrastructure with paving campaigns paired with the construction of a vast number of urban boulevards. Many cities have been somewhat negligibly designed away from proper transportation concepts, requiring further funding for demolition work so as to rationalize current practices and improve local logistical throughput for last mile movement off railheads. (180 Resources per Dice 0/250)

[]Central Asian Local Roads(Stage 1/3): Out of a likely sense of utter ignorance ranging on severe discrimination, the development of infrastructure in Central Asia has been practically left to primarily extractive means. Previous developments centered only on railways with which to move products out of the region alongside infrastructure only built for extraction rather than local utilization. To amend this a vast program of road construction has been planned to provide essential interlinks in difficult terrain and improve the local economies directly. Funding will go towards the rapid increase of local transportation networks in an urban and near urban context for the major cities and will be followed by the significant renovation and expansion of bridges and mountain roads so as to enable easy local transportation. (150 Resources per Dice 214/300)

[]Automotive Infrastructure(Stage 2/5): Deep insufficiencies of car based infrastructure have been a significant limiting factor to domestic modernization and one that must be addressed. Increasing parking spaces alongside improving the storage of cars when not in use remains a major concern for most older style apartment buildings with new garages essential for low density urban life. Distribution of work away from city centers is a consequence of somewhat excessive ecological reforms, but the practical reality is that more infrastructure alongside the distribution of automobiles is the only way to compensate. Further efforts are expected to directly enhance logistics infrastructure, aiding general transportation across the Union. (150 Resources per Dice 221/300)

[]Urban Sewage Systems: Sewage transportation by truck is the predominant form of sewage management for much of the Union's land mass. Urban systems exist but capacity limitations have posed significant development concerns outside of Moscow with severe limits placed on what can be done. Current programs focus on the urban issue as trucks, while inefficient, are not a direct health hazard that current management practices are. An expanded and modified program can be undertaken for large-scale urban renewal, integrating processing systems and greatly expanding capacities. This will take time and balloon the program above old standards but it will provide room for the economic centers of the Union to grow. (200 Resources per Dice 262/450) (-34 CI4 Electricity)

[]Black Sea Coaling Terminals: Supplies of Australian coal are desperately necessary to support rapid western economic development as deep structural insufficiencies of development require a temporary solution through imports. River reversal and its accompanying canals promise to solve the problem in half a decade but the Union does not have half a decade of stable domestic energy supplies if radical action is not taken. Opening primary harbors for the high volume import of Australian coal alongside developing the transfer infrastructure to move it onto the deep water system will take time, but it will temporarily stabilize the worst instability in current price-indexes.

[]Krasnoyarsk-Irkutsk Metallurgical Complexes(Stage 1/3): Lower-grade local ores in combination with the exploitation of new deposits and improved railway access are expected to significantly improve domestic steel production. The area has practical free electricity from the massive available hydro potential making it uniquely suited to large-scale steel processing and recycling. The proximity of natural gas sources of reduction has favored the area as one of the largest test cases for the primary DRI-EAF method with expectations for significant gains to local work and productivity. Much of the steel produced would go West, lowering local prices and further improving domestic productivity. (220 Resources per Dice 0/225) (-10 Steel -1 Non-Ferrous +1 General Labor +1 Educated Labor) (Hydroelectric Powered)

[]Secondary Metallurgical Complexes: Secondary steel can be salvaged to a large extent from the current steel economy. Despite strong export pressures, the domestic sector for steel utilization is strong and produces an excess of scrap steel. To meet domestic steel demand and minimize the need for reducing agents in production an expanded program for recycling steel can be started. Effective waste filtering has already been established and combustion processing inherently involves the separation of metal products. This will also yield some limited aluminum and copper, but those are secondary and far harder to filter from garbage streams.

[]Amur Electrolysis Plants: Mass production of aluminum from imported Indonesian Bauxite can start in the Far East to form a key industry and a basis for further development. Plentiful coal and easy logistics on the Amur leave the site optimal for the construction of a major electrolytic complex and the environment is well suited to the import of materials. Intensive development can directly supply the local industry and form a viable component of a complete domestic aluminum-production system as funding and technological sophistication improve. (240 Resources per Dice 0/100) (-76 CI8 Electricity -8 Non-Ferrous +1 General Labor)

[]Stepper Machine Evaluations: Western developments on more advanced methods to produce electronics beyond the scope of conventional photo-lithography have placed significant industrial demands on domestic industries. Focused development efforts alongside industrial ones will prioritize the production of an all domestic machine capable of smaller feature sizes so as to provide a long term means of advancement. Improving the scope of domestic production is further expected to lower prices across currently theoretical electronics packages, providing some advantages alongside the opportunity to close the gap across the 1980s. (360 Resources per Dice 0/75) (-26 CI8 Electricity +1 Educated Labor)

[]Kansk-Achinsk Intensification(Stage 1/4): Brown coal is the solution to the vast majority of energy problems in the far east and cheap brown coal will provide more than enough energy for local industrial development. Low-cost energy access is a fundamental basis of industrial development and increasing the scale of coal extraction will greatly aid with that. A new generation of heavy machinery is available to expand the scale of the pit mines alongside more efficient partial processing for regional exports. This renders the coal only somewhat cheap but the energy yields are more than economical. Further, intensive acid rains and the development of sulfurous fogs have been judged acceptable in the Southern Krasnoyarsk sacrificial zone, as local forestry is a negligible concern enabling the rapid expansion of coking projects. (180 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-39 CI4 Electricity -6 Coal +1 General Labor)

[]Localized Lignite Programs: Vast quantities of easily accessible lignite exist in the east and formalizing their use as a local source of energy and thermal coal can significantly reduce energy demands. Instead of working with a direct electrical demand in the planning system cogeneration with industry can become a formalized practice. Kuzbas and Kansk-Achinsk are both vast in reserves and can easily meet local energy demands through the intensification of extraction. Initial efforts will focus more so on logistics and increasing the production of basic turbines but a significant portion of energy demand can be atomized as a secondary concern.

[]Stabilization of Donbass Mining: Declining yields in the Donbass alongside the narrowing of seams is a prolonged and systematic problem that has yet to be solved. Intensification of the local industry and an expansion of labor power has only gotten so far with more advanced techniques required to extract the high value coals. Pushing for the adoption of an increased tempo of production alongside a deep modernization of machinery stocks will be an expensive but important bridge towards the general stabilization of coal demand for long enough to get trans-ural mining functional.

[]Coal Power Plants(CPSC): Coal is still a necessary part of the energy mix and one that cannot be ignored as it forms an essential basis for increasing energy production. Programs towards radically increasing the throughput of coal power are shortsighted before mining programs can achieve improved yields and an adequate barge route is developed. Still, coal is currently viable and prices of coal are expected to crash once heavier barges can be used, radically changing the entire economic principles of power in the Union. (300 Resources per Dice 2/100) (+150 Electricity +3 Coal) (Repeatable)

[]Kansk-Achinsk Coal Liquefaction(Stage 1/2): Collaborating closely with German efforts and transferring the technology or domestic applications offers something of a solution to the oil crisis. A series of integrated plants capable of processing 50Mt of coal per annum can be established alongside the expansion of pit mining to increase transportability. This coal will be converted to fuel at a high rate, securing significant gains in energy security even if current petroleum prices would necessitate operating slightly at cost to maintain prospective capacity. Only so much liquefaction can be developed but it at least offers a way to use domestic resources to meet the needs of the energy crisis. Energy demands will be met with local coal resources while reduction supplies can be obtained through the use of natural gas without economic issues.

[]Flue Gas Desulfurization: Taking measures to minimize secondary agricultural and industrial damage for older coal plants can provide moderate returns in improving overall economic activity. Western contemporary systems have had some success in reducing overall economic burdens and domestic developments can be utilized to close the gap. Near-urban and power infrastructure outside of sacrifice zones will be prioritized so as to reduce acute complaints and improve economic activity. Further work can take advantage of initial implementation and development programs as more mature scrubbers are expected to be practically cost neutral due to increased sulfur yields.

[]LuAZ Automotive Plant: Lower relative labor costs alongside an environment with easy access to energy and steel resources represents a prime location for the establishment of a heavier vehicle plant. A focus on heavier and larger vehicles can improve market saturation of an otherwise lightly produced category and provide increased consumptive pressure. In more rural areas heavier chassis with an integral 4x4 drive will improve performance and enable a degree of upselling. Export opportunities are further significant as the American industry is currently struggling to produce a modern competitive car for the segment.

[]ZIL Branch Plants: Luxury and sports vehicles represent a high profitability segment inherently and the expansion of ZIL and its associated plants has been significant just from incentive funds. To improve economic activity further funding can be allocated on the expansive production of luxury cars so as to improve general economic conditions. As the population gets wealthier the demand for luxury has only risen with significant demand placed on providing the most capable trims available. Close cooperation with Nissan is expected with some technical transfer promised as long as sufficient funding is allocated, driving the domestic sports car industry forward by approximately five to ten years.

Increased modernization capabilities alongside the development of a new engine system for midweight launches can improve tonnage launched and provide the basis for an improved RLA-3 alike configuration. Single central boosters represent significant cost reductions and the model of the RLA project has more than verified itself.

Hang on configurations for space launch have been considered, but detailed aerodynamic evaluations are necessary to develop the capacity. A target for a completed vehicle between 1983 and 1984 is ambitious though one that can be met by soviet industry. (-50 RpY Expected) (Subvote) (1 Dice)

[]Lunar Surface Development Program: The practical settlement of a research base onto the moon requires solutions to several essential technical problems. Local sourcing of long duration life support materials can significantly simplify logistical flights while further efforts towards understanding the environment for the purpose of locally sourced construction methodologies can sharply reduce mass costs. Evaluations done now will center on the development of a habitat capable of local construction alongside systems for reducing dependence on constant supply flights alongside developing the basic modules necessary to start a lunar base. (-20 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Long Term Habitation Program: Developing entirely new station hardware capable of sustaining a human presence in orbit remains key for establishing a moon base. If effective recycling and power production systems are not made, a lunar base will demand a consistent stream of material and energy that cannot be met through conventional means. The nuclear reactor program has already produced cores in the range of demanded capabilities but the questions of regolith processing and support for infrastructure on the lunar surface still remains a pressing question. (-20 RpY Expected) (1 Dice) (Subvote)

[]Advanced Nuclear Propulsion: Current developments on nuclear fueled stages have centered on unambitious solid cores that are only capable of use as limited upper stage engines with significant trade offs but further efforts can significantly improve performance. A focused development program on a closed cycle liquid nuclear core can enable the use of a wide variety of fuels in low orbit, enabling a variety of local harvesting and entirely solving soot issues inherent to higher density fuel. A methane-liquid core engine is expected to solve many of the issues inherent to the entire last generation of propulsion and open up the inner solar system to heavier probes alongside the use of reusable tugs on minimal hardware. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Non-Rocket Launch Methods: Rockets can only bring mankind so far in the exploration of space and further technological developments can bridge the gap. There are several concepts for launch ramps, elevators, loops, and a series of higher mass proposals. Constructing one would involve a massive commitment of funding well beyond the scope of availability but a smaller scale evaluation program can evaluate the immediate technological viability of some of the proposals. Large scale habitation of space cannot be done without abandoning the tyranny of the rocket equation and cheap launch mass can ensure that the American program is reduced to an obsolescent side-note. (-15 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)


Light Industry (12) 12 Dice

[]Air Conditioner Plants(Stage 7/7): Continued developments in the air conditioning sector are required to maintain the development of comfortable domestic housing. Smaller homes and older apartments are being modernized but at an inadequate pace with the acceleration of conventional construction. Further programs to increase the throughput of cooling systems can ensure that the oldest housing stock is modernized and brought into a comfortable state of living over the next decade. Once sufficient production capacity is established efficiency improvements are expected to provide a sufficient demand impetus to maintain profitability, solving the standard of living crisis compared to the Americans. (140 Resources per Dice 133/250) (-74 CI6 Electricity +2 Steel +2 Non-Ferrous +1 General Labor)

[]Consumer Electronics Plants(Stage 3/3): Cheap easy to use personal electronics have been an untapped sector with home radios and simpler systems generally under-produced. Expanding the industry into Central Asia alongside several new plants in the Ukrainian and Belorussian SSR can provide vast numbers of well paying jobs all while improving domestic electronic production. Demand for solid state electronics can be minimized through the preferential use of transistors for simpler systems as quantity can be somewhat prioritized over quality for many devices. (200 Resources per Dice 93/300) (-50 CI8 Electricity +2 Non-Ferrous +2 Petrochemicals +3 General Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Third Generation Food Programs(Stage 3/3): Borrowing developments from the Japanese market and modernizing them somewhat for the domestic one has brought in a series of highly economical products. Increasing the scope of meals that are simple to prepare while being shelf stable directly improves retail turnover while also serving to improve the variety offered to the soviet consumer. The goal of the current program will be to continue the expansion of novel products, improving the domestic food situation alongside expanding conventional selections. (160 Resources per Dice 182/225) (-35 CI3 Electricity +2 Petrochemicals +3 General Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Mobile Telephone Experiments: With advanced developments in batteries alongside the standardization of international wireless communications it is time to replicate some of the advances domestically. An integrated unit capable of being untethered and using wireless networks will be the goal of the program even if practical market use is not expected for the next few years. More so a technological development program to master the production of the components of the likely future of business then one of direct production, starting the process now can have vast economic returns both direct and indirect.

[]Consumer Pharmaceutical Production(Stage 1/2): The soviet worker has enjoyed an adequate supply of general purpose medications but it has been noted that cheaper more mass-utilization ones have been overwhelmingly imported. Developing the domestic industry to the point it can take on these demands is crucial with funding primarily allocated towards scaling up production. Incorporation of improved standards for the medications has somewhat raised the price of production but that can be compensated for with funding alongside a strong domestic expansion of already proven enterprises that currently supply the majority of the domestic sector. (180 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-32 CI4 Electricity +3 Petrochemicals +2 Educated Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Synthetic Textile Mills(Stage 1/3): A direct lack of economic prospects for the average textile worker makes conventional production impractical, but new techniques and improving technologies can return some profitability into the sector. Vast amounts of domestic synthetic fiber production require specialized tooling that cannot be easily replicated in India or China, providing the opportunity for a significant novel market segment. Intensive funding in poorer regions combined with a rapidly growing plastics industry is expected to close the profitability gap and further provide a stabilizing effect on the likely to slowly collapse conventional textile industrial-complex. (120 Resources per Dice 0/250) (-34 CI1 Electricity +6 Petrochemicals +4 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Secondary Plastics Industries: Plastics are objectively superior to any contemporary product produced in the Soviet Union and current shortages of non-ferrous metals can be somewhat compensated for through the rapid adoption of plastics. Increased production of containers and several other thermoplastic products for use in general use of durable goods will be key to lowering the demand for metals and conserving them for more important sectors. In practice, the reduction in metal use will be minimal if only due to the likely rapidly rising demand for new goods overtaking any savings.

Chemical Industry (6) 4 Dice

[]Exploitation of the East Siberian Basin(Stage 1/2): Several previously untapped petroleum reserves exist in the Far East with exploratory drilling already started on several identified fields. Most reservoirs that have been found are a combination of small and remote reserves without massive capacity for new production, but they are existent and worth extraction in a primary and secondary recovery sense. Continued operations are unlikely to produce any radical increases in petroleum production but even mild gains can assist in stabilizing economic activity.

[]Development of the Southern Turgay Basin(Stage 1/2): Expansive extraction operations in the Kazakh SSR are expected to stimulate the local economy and provide a mixture of gas and petroleum resources for rapid development. Local reserves are comparatively small and somewhat challenging to access but intensive production can provide rapid and significant gains for the local economy. Construction of several new oil towns alongside the intensive expansion of local refining infrastructure is expected to produce thousands of new high-paying jobs and tens of thousands of jobs supporting them. Operations are going to be limited by the conditions of the reserves in place but some gains are still expected.

[]River Reversal Zone Petroleum Extraction: With the flooding of several oil reserves the time to start adaptation work is now. Shortfalls in domestic oil production cannot be endured as speculative instability at current prices has already been significant. Improving confidence by recovering previously believed to be irrecoverable fuel is going to be essential to improve overall economic confidence. Extraction programs will center on hardening for the inevitable flooding of the region alongside developing new capacities to extract from the soon to be shallow lake. The technical aspects are already largely resolved, leaving only questions of funding new construction.

[]Modernization of Oil Fields(Stage 2/4): Combined programs to continue the modernization of the conventional petrochemical sector have benefited from the transfer of equipment originally meant for the Caspian, if deeply inefficiently. Continued modernization of primary wellheads is necessary to improve recovery fractions and slow general depletion through the utilization of more advanced techniques. The domestic chemical industry has met challenge after challenge and moved itself through twenty years of technological development, leaving the current priority towards general modernization. Domestic production systems are as modern as Western ones, and taking advantage of that will be the key to overcoming any shortage in energy resources. (160 Resources per Dice 69/175) (-42 CI4 Electricity -5 Petroleum Fuels -5 Petroleum Gas) (High Profitability)

[]Continued Synthetic Rubber Programs: Continued deep modernizations and expansions of the domestic rubber industry offer a way to significantly improve domestic incomes while increasing independence. Direct expansions of the industry are technologically possible through improved techniques, providing flexible and higher-performance polymers to several other critical industrial areas. Work on the overall rubber industry is only expected to increase as the automotive and general industrial sectors reach maturity with the demand for improved sealants and synthetic products rapidly increasing.

[]Next Generation Plastics Programs: Expanding the production of specialty and engineering plastics is somewhat of a distraction with the strong growth of the industry but one that still needs to be addressed. New and improved feedstocks and a rapidly developing chemical industry driven by cheap energy is a viable export industry and one that can significantly contribute towards domestic growth. Increasing funding for the more experimental applications of new plastics including the wholesale replacement of stainless steel in some applications will be key to improving domestic competitiveness and technological sophistication. (240 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-41 CI6 Electricity +4 Petroleum Gas -4 Petrochemicals +1 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Continued Exploitation of Volga-Ural: The tapping of massive reserves at an accelerated pace can provide for a cheap and fast increase in petroleum production to compensate for depletion in other areas. The massive formations are steadily decreasing in productivity as exploitation continues to deplete reserves despite improved recovery methods and the continuous development of new methodologies. These initiatives would in practice accelerate the depletion of deposits in the region, yielding plentiful cheap oil from the massive formations but causing a faster loss of total production as oil becomes uneconomical.

[]West Siberian Gas Wells(Stage 3/10): Vast quantities of gas exist all across Siberia and they are absolutely critical for maintaining the current energy markets. The transition to the use of gas will not come without radical changes and by ensuring the price remains near the well-price enterprises can be encouraged to switch and take pressure away from the oil sector. Any deficiency in energy will have to be overcome through the intensification and expansion of gas extraction and there is a practically unlimited quantity under the Siberian basin. Experiments with enhanced recovery methods will be further trialed, expanding the reservoirs that can be tapped.

[]Intensive Cracking Infrastructure(Stage 2/2): Direct upgrading infrastructure can be constructed to take advantage of the current surpluses of heavier oils. Instead of direct combustion or the production of more valuable synthetic lubricants, production can go somewhat to direct upgrading. New compounds will inherently be produced from cracking to maintain a high-value production chain but some of it can easily be allocated towards fuels instead of a true multi-stage processing approach. Improved refinery infrastructure past this point can provide some minor technical gains but that is miniscule compared to improved extraction.

Agriculture (6) 4 Dice

[]Domestic Meat Programs(Stage 7/10): Meat independence outside of beef requires a concentrated effort to increase and optimize the production of pork. Pig stocks have rapidly increased for the production of specialty goods but general-purpose pork has only moderately expanded during the previous plan. A concentrated effort to radically increase the number of pigs raised and slaughtered in the Union will be essential to overcoming any shortcomings of the domestic meat industry. Initial concepts will continue the caloric optimization of the pig with breeding programs initiated to produce pigs that can more efficiently take on calories, grow faster, and efficiently use lower-grade feeds without excessive loss of productivity. (120 Resources per Dice 6/225) (-34 CI1 Electricity +1 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Fruit Expansion Program: Increasing the focus on new fruits will provide a vast number of jobs to otherwise under-served communities and improve the overall economy. Agricultural profitability will not be raised by further expansions of grain but through a strong commitment to alternative means of production. In effect enterprises in more Southern areas will be provided benefits in water allocation alongside regular tax benefits for the localization of fruit production. Practical impacts will be limited as the trees grow but significant profits can be realized in the next few years. (150 Resources per Dice 0/175) (-11 CI1 Electricity) (High Profitability)

[]Water Efficiency Programs: The defining factor of the agricultural industry is the inputs put into the soil with the material acting more so as a temporary storage medium than an inherent factor. Continuing to provide improvements in water efficiency will stabilize the supply of one essential part of the equation as the chemical industry hammers away at feedstock shortages from the other direction. Drip irrigation requires a vast amount of plastic to implement and sustain but given the domestic industry that can be met to entirely solve issues of water accessibility. We now have the opportunity to break away entirely from the cycle of droughts that has plagued Russia and the Union, all that is needed is a final decisive effort.

Services (16) 11 Dice

[]Wireless Communications Networking: Paralleling and repeating the developments of Western first generation wireless systems is going to be necessary to bring urban workers an improved degree of overall communication. Analog forays into signaling and phone calls over the air represent significant technical gains and ones that can be reached with entirely domestic production. Efforts to start development will focus on major urban centers first so as to provide the most tangible gains with the technology likely to be distributed as it improves in sophistication. (200 Resources per Dice 0/100) (+1 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Transportation Enterprises(Stage 5/5): Further increases to local truck stocks will increase the demand in the rapidly growing automotive industry but for once it can mostly need the demand. Production of cabover vehicles has increased nearly twenty-fold in the last decade with further gains expected as large and small transportation enterprises are expanded. Work towards improving throughput and efficiency can still be done in collaboration with further road construction to bring the Union into the modern era of internal transportation.

[]Second Wave Hotel Programs(Stage 1/3): Current business supporting infrastructure is deeply lacking compared to the West as there are in practice two centralized hotel-focused enterprises of mediocre quality. Developing a further three hotel enterprises with one targeting the high-end sector and two aiming to be as inexpensive as possible will improve support for travelers and significantly aid local incomes. Business infrastructure will readily apply to general tourism such that improving both will provide local areas with more access alongside gains in general economic efficiency. (150 Resources per Dice 0/125) (-16 CI2 Electricity +1 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Expanding Roadside Logistics(Stage 2/2): Fuel provisions for the most common vehicles are still lacking in effect limiting the mobility of passenger vehicles. Extended-range operations and staying in the inhabited belt have somewhat ameliorated current problems but further expansions are still needed to fully support the rapid increase in consumer car ownership. Reinforcement of urban gas stations alongside those in smaller cities will be essential for the program to ensure that queues are minimized and transportation access is improved.

[]Expanded Barcoding(Stage 1/3): Use of scanned codes on every surface and platform represents a radical improvement in precision across a wide variety of industries. Initial proposals to modernize the railway system with them can be accelerated through an expanded use of computing to simplify loading and somewhat save on labor. Scanning of information from simple codes will verify goods that are shipped and provide a cross-intelligible system of regulations. Mainframes on each end of the shipping network can act according to standardized shipping codes further simplifying the railway system.

[]Modernization of Catering: Workers that are served food by associated enterprises have had several complaints about the quality and degree of products served. By working nationally to create a standardized formulary of high durability products and ensuring their wide distribution these problems can somewhat be fixed. High shelf life foods are becoming common and providing the options to many workers can significantly improve the perception of food quality available. Work to modernize old kitchens and implement health standards will accompany the general modernization, improving overall standards through focusing on the worst enterprises.

Bureaucracy 8 Dice

[]Dedicate Focus Towards a Project(): (1 Bureau Dice for +5 per dice on a project, +15 in Chemical Industry) (Unrolled)

[]CPSU Led State Union: Stopping the right wing tendency of separating the state union and further reducing its socialist character is a popular trendline if one that is going to have mixed effects. Ensuring that the party is tightly tied into the union will take some concessions in other matters but its weakness and enforced from above right wing nature make it fertile ground from radical change. Unification of organizational bodies alongside the union's total subordination to the party will give it teeth where the party is willing to be involved but otherwise likely return the conditions of the fifties. It's not impossible to get some of the more aware technocrats to advocate for a line, but the extent of change still can provide a dangerous precedent. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Leftists)

[]Modernize Industrial Standards: Expanding the role of labor in controlling industry and somewhat shifting the balance towards an increased emphasis on technically skilled labor can ameliorate both the technocrats and more general leftists. Now that there is a surplus of well educated personnel they can receive elevated administrative roles with workers boards in effect overwhelmingly favoring educated party members over current approaches. Expanding their control will be justified through the effective expansion of mid-ranking positions on them, providing improved coordination and subordinating rapidly declining unskilled labor in the long run, even if the current policy is sufficiently rephrased to avoid the implication. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Technocrats)

[]Guest Labor Reforms: Imposition of minimalistic cultural standards on the guest workers alongside removing some of the conditional requirements for the use of unskilled workers can provide major economic stimulation. Workers with incompatible educations from outside of CMEA have a vast degree of economic potential if properly utilized and better economic efficiency focused approaches can improve their useability. Popularized by more conservative voices chasing arbitrary standards of "culture" a political line in discrediting the education and working standards of non-european labor can still pass. This will shore up support from the conservatives and stalinists while further lowering the cost of essential labor in the economy as positions with few protections and even lower pay are formally opened. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Stalinists/Conservatives)

[]Formalize Combinat-Labor Associations: Guest workers have posed several issues with persistent wage increases and a lack of general capability. Working to revive some elements of old systems can be a potent way of placating several major industrial enterprises while pivoting towards a line of improving internal discipline for those obsessed with it. The Stalinists are somewhat delusional about the practice improving work rates or reducing over-stays but it can still have some favorable political results for little practical cost. Formalization of complete ties of guest workers to their sponsoring enterprises alongside the modification of residency requirements will minimize additional social burdens and likely lower costs in the moment, placating all but the far left if passed. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Stalinists/Conservatives/Technocrats)

[]Introduce Political Articles: Blatantly and explicitly claiming that the current radical right opposition is anti soviet and deserving of punishment as Western agents is a dramatic radical step that will go nowhere. Radicalism is in itself a useful means of attaining significant support without any intent to follow it through allowing the position to stand without committing fully to it. Having a loyal ally propose new articles advocating for the effective and retroactive charge of ten years without correspondence for far right ideological and political personages will cause the entire affair to likely die in the first unofficial vote but a bit of fear can alter turnout and more importantly show the proverbial flag for the faction. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Leftists/Stalinists)

[]Cybernetic Control Experiments: Expanding automatic control of enterprises and enforcing basic standards for efficient control infrastructure has been a popular tendency. Establishment of computing centers focused on the communication of financial, technical, and business information can be started now as a follow-on to initial networking programs. The reformists and left will complain over imaginary infringements on socialist labor but they are irrelevant and can either be placated or ignored. Funding will go from the Supreme Soviet onto an ambitious series of research programs aimed at establishing regional networked communications, allowing for the economy to develop more rapidly. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Stalinists/Technocrats)

[]Pivot Towards Soviet Nationalism: The symbols of the great patriotic war and several domestic cultural phenomena have been ignored in favor of more broad scope cultural programs. Reviving old concepts of a single Soviet nation can provide some cheap nationalism to justify the likely hardship that will come from the energy crisis. Pivoting the current cultural programs away from past ones will be more challenging but authorizing funding is unlikely to be. A vast impact is not expected but even being able to stand and take the political line should somewhat shore up support amongst the conservatives at no cost. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Conservatives)

[]Establish a Unitary Global Development Framework: Previous engagements in the third world have been limited due to a lack of understanding and somewhat passivity as a part of general relations. Retreat from unconditional towards more mutual relations alongside expanded funding for foreign primary economic sectors will be key to maintaining current industrial economics and implementing the framework to do so around the MFA will provide significant future growth. Technocratic policy making centered on strong primary-extractive sector growth underwritten by loans and imports will provide local jobs and if friendly relations are maintained through expanded basing networks, provide for the Union through the next two decades. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Stalinists/Technocrats)

[]Subvert the Ministry of Culture: It's been noted by even several more moderate faction members that disagreed with Zimyanin that the ministry of culture has been little but a right wing mouthpiece. Moving into a strong attack on it now with the aim of sacking the minister and reversing cultural standards will somewhat reduce throughput but also serve to restore a more authentic socialist culture without supposed capitalist degeneracy. The nonexistence of such degeneracy not notwithstanding giving the Stalinists and leftists some comparatively harmless windmills to chase can keep them busy as agitation over the newest film is a highly effective distraction for the less rational members. (1 Dice) (Supreme Soviet Reform) (Favored by Leftists/Stalinists)

[]Destabilize the Center: Expanding the electoral context to a direct confrontation with Vorotnikov is ambitious and yet is essential for securing any long term power to weather the coming crisis. There is no means of doing so but to directly challenge the presence of the conservatives with a new political direction capable of taking the radical measures necessary to improve the economy without falling to the excesses of the right wing Vorotnikov has so heavily mired himself in. Any basis in reality of the statement can be ignored in favor of pushing for a unified factional message as enough initiative, coordination, and aggression can likely sweep away the weakening conventional conservatives. (1-3 Dice)

[]Restart a Work-Hours Commission: Verifying the developments of Voznesensky and expanding the assessments of labor can help to continue to provide a scientific basis for improved productivity. Current work hours are optimized for a mixed productive-demand state but can likely be shifted to optimize other aspects essential to economic activity especially now that labor demand has rapidly increased. Maintaining a balanced demand state will be key for stable economic growth especially now that the baby boom is slackening and newly graduating students are available in lesser quantities. (1 Dice)

[]Army-Ministry Budget Requests: The MoD has had too much of a budget for too long and cutbacks are going to be needed to stimulate economic growth. Economic growth forms the basis of the military and the technologies involved rendering it a higher priority to achieve instead of the development of some new overpriced weapon system. Belik is currently somewhat politically weak and not the best liked, providing an opportunity to intercede on the next budget to allocate surplus funding, stopping the growth of the defense budget. (1 Dice)

[]Expanding Health Ministry Funding: Taking a strong stance against a disease is well and good but funding for the process can come from other aspects of state development. Maintaining the economy under the stress of the disease is already a major problem and further reductions in funding will only degrade productivity. Moving the supreme soviet to expand funding by taking from less important ministries will make some enemies but it will also be a decisive response to the crisis and start the process towards solving it. (1 Dice)

[]Stimulus Measures: The combination of LASV alongside flagging growth in conventional industrial sectors can be justified as a sign of the somewhat expected delayed economic downturn. Using that to justify increased funding may result in it getting applied too early but the increased growth demands present will require further allocations of resources and material. A partial increase will be asked for and likely granted, increasing state debts so as to avoid a significant economic downturn. (1 Dice) (Immediate 3000R, Repaid at 500/y for 7 years)

[]Automotive Reforms: Automotive demand is a core part of heavy industrial growth but slow increases in production have plagued the sector, especially with the lack of allocated enterprise funding. Reversing this will take more time but first reforms can be instituted to open the roads to more motorists, incorporating infrastructure to increase the density of car use and provide for expanded registration. Unified examination standards that do not require as much of an educational basis will increase accessibility and ensure a steady demand base that will further drive economic expansions. (1 Dice)

[]Housing Sector Reform: Current housing programs are working to maintain housing stocks but the massive risk of the Mikoyan era housing decaying has remained a national concern. The homes themselves have held up better than expected but they need to be replaced at an accelerated time frame. Improved apartment models have already been sufficiently developed to reduce costs per unit with current plans simply needing modification. This will commit the Union to the largest housing program in history but in a decade the communal housing form and wartime emergency housing can be left in the past. (1 Dice)

[]Discredit Ecological Programs: Those who talk of greening and slowing the engineering of nature until it bends to the workers' whim only want to go backward towards primitive capitalist accumulation. Current green energy efforts are being continuously propagandized as an utter failure in the development of a technique utterly incompatible with maintaining industrial efforts but the program can be taken a step further. Ecological programs can be directly undermined at every step with studies pushed to counter any narrative of devastation and undermine the delusional approach towards nature honoring the untouched wild for no other reason than boredom with urban life.

Current Economic Prices(Domestic/CMEA/International): (How this will work is that every action above except for electricity modifies the internal price of the commodities below. They also vary on their own and are sorted into abstracted 1-100 ranges. Modifiers from the rest of your economy are displayed below with each category of goods. When you shift between 20-sized ranges, there can be significant modifiers to the general economy that come from changing prices of core commodities. CMEA prices determine the price in CMEA, though transportation of goods will be a problem with international prices representative of the West.)
