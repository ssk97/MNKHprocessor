Internal Politics:

Strong economic growth post the mobilization scare has proceeded with the partial decoupling of American industries coming to several issues immediately. Strong tariffs placed on steel have minimized the movement of resources but it does not represent adequate action to achieve a full decoupling. Ashbrook attacks on the economy have partially been weathered through diversification with trade volume increasing with secondary goods and especially through secondary states. Exports of materials that received minimal final assembly in Turkey have started at scale with few American allies willing to decisively decouple their economies in a radical act. The pressure of American enterprises along the Western market state has caused several localized pricing spikes and a shifting around of demand more than a total encirclement of the Union.

In worse news for the economy, the system is running hot to a nearly incredible degree with the mobilization scandal so far failing to put a dent in otherwise strong economic growth. Gains in energy use have proceeded unabated with a steady acceleration of demand across both fuel and electric sectors. Further, full employment as an effective condition of the employment market has been achieved with a nearly negligible number of workers seeking work directly causing steadily increasing inflexibility of the economy. Growth in the moment is strong but it will not last and a critical political decision will have to be made on the strengthening or weakening of spending across the next plan. Another five years of growth might be achievable but it will not be sustainable on energy, much less personnel.

Fighting between Ashimov and Zimyanin over political messaging and the Supreme Soviet has practically defined the far left with Zimyanin somehow managing to appeal to students and several otherwise conservative party members. Vorotnikov has not been the equal of Romanov but he has managed to stop the bleeding away of both youths and more conventional conservatives through several personal compromises and comprehensive work on internal factional diplomacy. The conservative flank consisting of both of them is not stable in the current moment but it is if anything more centralized than it should be with the loss of Romanov. There is something of an agreement of a compromise government forming between the two if the elections proceed as predicted due to several factors radically changing the factors around the election.

Semyonov has spent his time working on consolidating party organs ignoring the importance of state ones. This treatment of the CPSU as the end all be all of domestic politics has effectively had him neglect to provide any attention to the election, moving around chairs in the central committee that decides very little in practice. In practice, the center of Soviet politics is less collapsing more that it is drifting away to any port in a storm with several representatives already going into backroom meetings to secure endorsements. Podgorny has managed to pass the torch to Ryzhkov with few internal conflicts and a general affirmation of him as the new rising figure in the Ministry of Finance. The man himself has moved to a more conservative angle with some freedom from Podgorny but it is uncertain how much he will be able to exploit Semyonov's weakness.

The far right for its part has continued between Dzhussoev and Gulyam and between the two the argument for reducing enterprise control instead of effectively giving them away for a pittance has won over much of the party. Increased initiative is the word of the day and the enterprise managers have practically fallen over themselves on promises to desperately avoid Dzussoev. This has made him far more popular with the youths than the man ever expected as many of Ashimov's core supporters have raised him as the man of the workers despite no real ability to secure it. The results of this are if anything unpredictable as thousands of local party members are intensely maneuvering with immense optimism on every side.


Military Developments Pt.3 Navy:

With the Algerian conflict a comprehensive modernization program to bring the Red Fleet to adequate standards for combating the newest classes of enemy warships. This has come with an expanded funding program that has come as something of a compromise between other areas of the armed forces, reducing the cost of the tank force by slowing the adoption of new systems. Construction programs have so far aimed to bring the current force to something of a standard with the universalized introduction of integrated circuits to fire control and sensor systems along with the start of a mass naval build program for the 1976-1985 period. A fleet capable of taking on the US will not be possible to construct, but one that can expand power projection and flexibly defend bastion areas in wartime conditions.

Through the collection of important military intelligence along with the expansion of the Northern listening arrays the submarine force has necessitated a radical modernization program. Both the 611 and 613s were the first on the chopping block as the boats represented little new capability and were only effective as compact metal graves for fifty to seventy men. The 627 class has also been retired from any form of military service, with all ten constructed boats moved to training duties with the expectation of being scrapped in five years for noise, sensor limitations, and lacking agility. Out of the older diesel boats only the 633s and 641s have received a stay of execution as both classes are only expected to be replaced once adequate numbers of 877s are constructed.

New 877 class boats are expected to replace much of the diesel submarine fleet and perform duties in Northern Bastion zones along with some areas of the Pacific. Partnerships with German technical firms have resulted in an improved drive train developed as a successor over local systems with reduced noise, extended range, and new high-efficiency batteries. The boat's major innovations have come in the form of a teardrop hull in line with the 671, greatly increased automation, and a full low-frequency sonar system alongside a deployable array. She is expected to become the quietest class of submarine in the fleet and serve an ideal role for immediate combat operations around the GIUK gap and Pacific operations. Sprint speeds of twenty-five knots are not expected to be sufficient to keep pace with her nuclear contemporaries but those are unlikely to be critical outside full-scale warfare.

Guided missile submarine forces have seen the retirement of 659 class boats from all frontline duties, moving them to training units. The 670 class at the same time has received significant improvements in the form of tiling across the majority of surface area and a new generation of onboard electronics. A towed array and improved screw geometry are expected to bring the class to something of a generation 2.5 standard even if post-construction quieting is expected to be inadequate. New surface attack options have come in the form of the 949 class consisting of a massive dual 180MWt reactor core boat capable of carrying twenty supersonic sea skimmers as a primary anti-convoy strike asset. Quieting onboard is expected to be short of a true third-generation boat, but adequate compared to all current operational fleet assets.

Ballistic missile submarines have received similar improvements in quieting as the 670s to bring them to a generation 2.5 standard but towed arrays have been decided as unnecessary for the role. The largest modernization across the entire 667B series has come in the form of new MIRV-capable missiles, greatly expanding undersea ordnance capacity and nuclear weapons in service without a major cost increase. Development work on a new class of SSBNs has started but comprehensive work is needed to leapfrog American developments on a reasonably sized vessel. Older class members are expected to struggle compared to the modernized boats, but there is little that can be done with funding allocated for frontline combat assets.

Attack boat development has been split into four distinct routes of development, expending a considerable amount of funding even if future vessels are to be consolidated into a binary system. The 671 class has universally received towed array systems, new screws, and electronics modernizations to bring them up to an external if not internal RTM standard. The new generation of the 671 boats has come with greatly enhanced quieting from the near total isolation of the propulsion section to reduce noise production. Noise from cooling has also been reduced through the modernization of the reactor core to reduce background sound production without any compromise to speed, bringing new construction boats to a competitive standard.

Interceptor submarine development has come in the form of the 705 class being concluded at six boats with a follow-on 705D class of a further six boats started to demonstrate advanced technical features along with developments in automation. The use of a new pump jet along with a significantly enlarged propeller has achieved a partial reduction in cavitation through increased pressure on a secondary drive screw when achieving an expected speed of forty-five knots. A reinforced titanium hull is expected to increase operational depth to the point that cavitation can be avoided in primary engagement regimes. Improved electronics on the project are expected to reduce crew sizes to twenty-nine with the four thousand-ton boat extensively automated. Armament is going to consist of the same six tubes and eighteen reserves of previous 705 series boats, but that is judged as acceptable given a primary role as a direct anti-submarine combatant.

The true next-generation submarine program has been separated between two prospective routes of modernization. On the expensive and technical demonstration end the 945 class has been developed as a hybrid between the 671 and 705, featuring a titanium hull and 180MWt reactor system. The new boat is going to be built around a titanium hull automation system partially borrowed from the 705 and a new sonar system with large conformal arrays. An all-transistorized electronics suite is expected to be the largest modernization with new conformal side arrays and the use of a new towed array. Diving depth and mobility are expected to be more than any non-titanium submarine, enabling an expanded variety of combat maneuvers to be conducted. The primary armament is a similar six automatically loaded torpedo tubes with thirty-two reserves. Six of these advanced boats are expected to be built with the technologies incorporated into the 971 class upon maturity.

Third-generation mobilization boats in the form of the 971 are similar to the 945 in general capability if larger with a steel hull and less ambitious technical specifications. Lesser automation has increased the crew complement while the larger size and identical power-reactor system has moderately reduced the top speed of the submarine. The new class is expected to be built en masse to supplement the older generation two boats, with twenty laid down in the 1976-85 build period. Conversions of the 671RTM yards to modern boats will also finish by the end of the period, accelerating the construction of general-purpose mobilization submarines. Somar and quieting improvements have been broadly borrowed from the 945 programs with many adaptations to reduce noise and greatly expand detection envelopes through better electronics. Further production and modernized classes are only theoretical with the 971 expected to make up the majority of submarines laid down from 1986-90 assuming consistent funding.

To parallel advanced innovations in fielded torpedoes and avoid a capability gap with the Americans, a combined German-Soviet universal torpedo project was started with the first examples expected to be deployed in three years. The UGST is designed based on a new mono-propellant engine to approach the capability of new American systems, achieving speeds of fifty knots for a thirty-kilometer runtime with an augmented terminal mode at shorter ranges. Improvements in seeker design have achieved significant gains in automatic analysis, extending the range threefold relative to SET-65 systems. Wire guidance is available to provide improved guidance for the torpedo with a limited back-band signal to improve the precision of fire. Terminal phase guidance and significant maneuvering are expected to disrupt the wire but performance is still expected to be well above TEST-71 prototypes.

With the use of gun weaponry broadly confirmed in validity if not any form of larger scale guns several innovations have been introduced to modernize the fleet. On the heaviest end, a standardized 130mm in dual mounting with automatic loading is expected to become the principal gun arm of heavier fleet vessels. On the lighter end, a new generation of 100mm rapid-fire single barrel guns has been made capable of directly being mounted to old twin 76mm mounts to expand range envelopes. The replacement of the lightest weapon system in service has come in the form of a 76mm high rate of fire gun, primarily intended for anti-aircraft and anti-missile work. New tungsten-enhanced proximity rounds have been designed to reduce the effect of missiles to provide secondary capability outside of point-blank range engagement capability.

The requirements of missile warfare have necessitated the acceleration of the development of high-fire-rate thirty-millimeter guns with the new AK-630 series to be placed on all modern platforms. New targeting radars have provided a capability for independent engagement of two anti-missile systems, significantly increasing vessel durability against subsonic missile attack. Direct modernizations of the P-15M have come in the P-15Y through the incorporation of solid-state electronics, a massively improved targeting complex, and an enlarged conventional high explosive warhead. Range extension has achieved a 90 km effective range along with a 25m sea-skimming attack profile. All compatible ships are expected to receive the new system while newly constructed vessels will receive improved P-120 missiles with significant gains in technical capabilities along with a true low-altitude flight mode.

P-500 systems have formed the heavy component of the anti-shipping missile complex, capable of shots to 600 km over the 150km of the P-120. This has been combined with an attack profile capable of mach two flights on the approach, increasing the chance of penetration. High-level flight on the approach introduces some vulnerability to interception of the large missile by fighter elements, but this is considered acceptable for a heavy-weight system. Dedicated anti-aircraft systems have come in the development of a new light-medium-heavy weight complex capable of flexible fleet defense. On the lightest end, the Osa is expected to form the closest rung of air defense with plans calling for near-universal mounting. Buk systems are expected to broadly replace S-125 systems on new construction vessels, increasing high-speed tracking and moving to solid-state electronics. Further work on a heavy missile system has seen the start of the development of a naval TVM variation on the soon-to-come heavy theater S-300P system.

At the lowest operational level for the development of a sufficient navy to contest the seas by 1985 came the corvette program. Ships of 1241 displacing eight hundred tons with light radar systems, sufficient seakeeping for 5000 km, and deployments of up to twenty days have been pushed towards production. Primary armament involves a complex of 4 P-15Y missiles along with a 76mm gun for dual-purpose operations. Anti-aircraft armament is limited to two AK-630 systems, protecting against missiles and aircraft to a limited extent. The primary goal of the class is Mediterranean deployments from Greek ports along with limited Pacific duties, forming the basis of low-cost assets that can pose a significant naval threat in confined waters.

Based on the same hull, an ASW variation has been developed to be built in concert, featuring a quad launcher of the Metel complex and two 400mm ASW torpedo tubes along with a towed array and hydrophone complex. This involves the replacement of the propulsion complex with easier-to-manufacture diesel engines. Approximately seventy vessels of both variations are expected to be built by 1985 with the first laid down in two years. Further construction has the ship expected to replace the majority of short-range anti-submarine warfare systems with frigates prioritized more towards fleet defense and anti-aircraft operations. Current roles for the ship exist as a combined anti-submarine warfare patrol complex to protect bastion zones and allow submarines to operate outside of them to degrade wartime capabilities in a European or Asian theater.

Of all the ships that have received significant refits, the 1135s have received the most significant layout changes. New construction vessels are to replace their primary anti-aircraft complex with a twin-boom Osa system to provide room for more comprehensive anti-missile systems. Both twin 76mm gun turrets are replaced by 100 mm rapid-fire systems, achieving a considerable increase in close-range combat potential. The Metel complex onboard has been modernized to a new standard of capability to improve anti-submarine warfare performance. Two AK-630 close-in defense systems round out the vessel, making the second generation of the class a comprehensive improvement across the ship. Sensor improvements have also been significant with the move to solid-state electronics expanding the capabilities of most onboard systems.

Next-generation frigates outside of the umbrella of the 1135s have come with the development of the 1166 class. The new vessels have effectively increased in displacement to 4300 tons but this has enabled a general modernization of armament and capability to form the core of a universal seagoing frigate force. Twin 100mm guns are paired with a twin AK-630 defensive system with independent targeting for both to increase resistance to missile attack. Improvements in air defense have come with a twin-range system incorporating a dual-arm Buk launch system to provide air defensive capability. Anti-submarine capabilities have been consolidated to the use of a variation on UGST torpedoes or new tube-launched RPK-2 systems over a full metal complex. A limited anti-ship armament in the form of quad P-120 launches is planned to be deployed, creating a general-purpose frigate capable of fulfilling all fleet roles.

To modernize strike components a modern destroyer capable of adequate anti-shiping fire has been developed to pair with the 1166. Incorporating the lessons learned the ships are armed with two twin 130mm guns along with a quad arrangement of AK-630 systems to provide universal close-in defensive fire against several simultaneous missile targets. The nearly eight thousand-ton ship is planned to integrate an S-300P system capable of wide-scale naval defense with significant reserves of ammunition along with a twin Osa launcher for close-in defense. Four twinned P-120 launchers make up the practical anti-surface firepower of the vessel with the anti-submarine complex concentrated on the use of the torpedo tubes. A single-carried helicopter is expected to improve fleet ASW response but the vessel is primarily intended as a robust command post for other fleet assets.

Principle-heavy anti-shipping systems have been concentrated at the cruiser level with the development of the 1164 class. The ten-kiloton hull is expected to become the fleet's main missile combatant in areas without significant carrier presence and form the basis for high-velocity missile attacks. A single twin 130mm gun is paired with four AK-630 systems to form the basis of the main gun complex. The anti-shipping missile complex consists of eight twin mounts for P-500 systems, greatly expanding offensive capabilities and forming the mainstay surface strike asset. Anti-submarine systems are confined to the ship's torpedo system with the option to fire rocket-deployed torpedoes or UGST along with a single helicopter. The anti-aircraft complex is similar to the 1166, incorporating a S-300P system alongside a twin-arm Osa for close-range defense.

Both Kiev class ships have started to be converted and modernized for a new age of operations. The hulls themselves are decidedly poor but some improvements can still be made to expand operational capabilities. This has come in the mounting of two twin-boom Osa systems along with four AK-630s for close-in defensive capability. Operational air wings have become focused around the combination of Ka-27 helicopters and Yak-38s to provide seaborn cover for ASW operations with the carrier holding twelve Yak-38s for fleet defense and twenty-four Ka-27s. The ships themselves are mostly obsolete but with new systems and conversion to helicopter carriers over the next decade, adequate ASW defense can still be achieved.

The Moscow class carriers have continued to receive modernizations with a comprehensive modernization planned to bring the ships to something approaching a modern standard. Her air group has entirely replaced older and lighter aircraft with thirty-six Mig-23MKs to be paired with a complement of six Yak-44 AEW craft for fleet scouting and four Ka-27 helicopters. The primary armament is two twin Osa and Buk systems to provide fleet air defense with some limited anti-surface capability with six AK-630s for close-in defense. The largest changes if anything have come in the tower as many of the old systems will be replaced by solid-state radars, greatly expanding operational capabilities for both ships of the class.

More recently constructed Kharkov class carriers have received more minor modernizations, primarily to their anti-aircraft firepower. This has consisted of the mounting of eight AK-630 systems for the simultaneous engagement of 3 missiles from most directions and four from primary strike directions. Heavier systems are concentrated on two twin-arm Buk launchers, providing a consistent capability to engage and intercept subsonic targets. The strike wing has been brought up to forty-eight Mig-23MK airframes with four held in reserve alongside six Yak-44 AEW aircraft and eight ASW helicopters. Both Kharkov and Kursk are expected to serve as the primary fleet carriers of the Northern Fleet, providing adequate air cover to local submarine forces and reducing the threat of ASW assets.

The new capital ship of the fleet is the Volga class of which four are planned to be constructed. The first true nuclear carrier of the battlefleet is to be built around two larger power cores than any currently used in submarine operation. Further improvements to the design over previous carriers are expected in the form of an S-300P battery capable of engaging sixteen targets at the same time. Any direct anti-shipping armament has been discarded due to the lack of operational needs in the Black Sea with the primary area of operations expected either in the Pacific or North Sea. A strike wing of forty-eight to sixty Mig-23MKs is the primary combat element of the new ship alongside eight Yak-44 AEW aircraft and eight ASW helicopters to provide adequate capacity for defense. Two ships are expected to be constructed by 1982 with provisions made but not yet funded for a further two carriers.


Rocketry:

The RLA modernization program has achieved some results in improving the lifespan and reliability of the engine system along with mild improvements in the upper stack. This has increased single launcher capability to almost fifteen tons reliably but without the radical gains promised. The largest improvement has if anything come from lighter composite fairings as a six-meter fairing can be utilized without an excessive addition of weight to the launch system to facilitate the launch of larger and oddly shaped craft. Of these, the current Mars program has taken advantage of it with the launch of a set of rovers to the surface of the planet to assess local conditions around craters.

Expanded launch orders from the communication satellites program have brought reliable repetition of television signals to the most remote regions of the Union and several trans-Atlantic links. Unification of local networks is likely to take the use of more capable circuitry and signal processors but that is on track for implementation by 1985. The atmospheric satellite program has in itself confirmed the depletion of ozone over polar areas in a steady pattern with chemical confirmations made on the effect of several compounds on atmospheric ozone. These have primarily been found in refrigerants and pressurized propellants with use common across several industries.

First station launches have achieved the orbiting of a basic forty-ton extended station that is in practice an extended FGB bus with improved energy and scientific systems. Delivery of the crew and the last few experiments to the station has been successful with three-month-long crew rotations expected for the service life of the station module. Solar panel output has reduced faster than expected as the panels available have degraded in orbit but not sufficiently to abort the mission. Inflatable sections are not expected to be launched in any reasonable timeframe as the technical aspects of the program are still questionable for deployment to be authorized.

The continuation of the Luna program has continued to bring back small samples of rock but the focus has entirely shifted towards the use of a mostly autonomous lander. The lack of continuous light on the planet has forced the design to use a heavier RTG with plans calling for a high-capability rover capable of flexibly taking samples with six rovers planned to land at important locations to survey craters. Testing on the surface with batteries in place of the power plant has started to provide easy verification of capability for maneuvering on unstable terrain. Expanded scientific programs are expected around the craters as current theories believe that water ice may be present either in them or in the polar areas.

Galileo Program launches have almost arrived at Jupiter with both probes ready to provide an accurate picture of the local environment. These probes are inherently less capable than those set to be sent in the outer planets program but the scientific gains are expected to be immense. Failures have occurred in two of the sensors on the backup probe and the wide-angle camera on the main probe but the errors have if anything confirmed the durability of current electronic systems. Those that have worked are planned to be directly integrated into the more advanced outer planets probes to provide as accurate view of the outer planets when efficient trajectories are available.

The terrestrial firing of the RD-410 ribbon core engine with sustained burns of up to 900s was demonstrated with a continuous thrust of 46kN achieved across the engine. Efficiency reaching 910 seconds is expected from current core conditions leaving the engine a highly valuable platform for the launch of probes into extremely high orbits. Combining the weight of shielding and other engine systems the overall nuclear system has a worse TWR than expected but for the missions expected this has been judged as acceptable. Issues with the very high volume tanks needed to store LH2 are going to pose a technical problem, but not one that is fundamentally impossible to solve given adequate funding.

Infrastructure: (11) 4 Dice

[]Western Local Roads(Stage 1/2): Even the worst organized commission can determine that the roads in smaller towns and towards enterprises are inadequate for any form of large-scale industrial development. Personal assessments are not much better with the commissions' report if anything deeply optimistic. Mud has been a consistent issue when attempting to travel by car significant distances and the quality of roads away from anything of political importance rapidly degrades. Plans to fix the issue will start with the unification of the road system on a two-lane inter-town standard with primary routes built around factories to link local production resources into the general grid. Such a plan will delay primary population-focused roads, but it is expected to improve overall industrial conditions. (125 Resources per Dice 0/350)

[]Urban Sewage Systems: Sewage transportation by truck is the predominant form of sewage management for much of the Union's land mass. Urban systems exist but capacity limitations have posed significant development concerns outside of Moscow with severe limits placed on what can be done. Current programs focus on the urban issue as trucks, while inefficient, are not a direct health hazard that current management practices are. An expanded and modified program can be undertaken for large-scale urban renewal, integrating processing systems and greatly expanding capacities. This will take time and balloon the program above old standards but it will provide room for the economic centers of the Union to grow. (180 Resources per Dice 16/500) (-34 CI4 Electricity)

[]Civilian Airports(Stage 5/5): Continued works at expanding the regional airports to serve the local ones can start now that the general system of transit has been developed. Shortages of airframes are going to pose an issue for the rest of the decade but a combination of new models and new technologies will more than compensate for the deficiency. With the further development of local resources along with the focused expansion of regional hub airports, a new high throughput arial model can be constructed East of the Urals. (125 Resources per Dice 46/150)

[]CMEA LNG Pipelines: Constructing a high-flow LNG pipeline through the Belorussian SSR and into Poland that is then linked further into Europe can stabilize local energy supplies. This would stabilize the local energy market, keep prices of fuel lower, and enable the steady transition towards the use of natural gas in the next decade as oil prices continue their expected steady rise. Flow rates will be enough for massive expansions of local resources and a partial shift away from petroleum across the block to provide another half a decade of relative energy stability. (175 Resources per Dice 0/150)

[]Mikoyanka Renewal Program(Stage 1/3): Initial wartime-era housing and the massive programs that were built up in the aftermath require comprehensive restoration work. The homes were built to be replaced on a twenty-year timescale but that has not come in any significant amount due to population pressures across the country. In smaller cities, the problem has been partially ignored as new housing has been prioritized for areas of increasing density. To address this an assessment program can be started to check for structural issues. This will be accompanied by the total modernization of soundproofing, insulation, cladding, heating, and interiors to bring the oldest homes to the appearance and energy efficiency standards of modern construction. (120 Resources per Dice 0/250)

[]Modernization of Heating Infrastructure: Working to improve the thermal efficiency of structures and re-coating heat pipes is a major infrastructural effort but one that needs to be undertaken to reduce waste. Current practices for grid heating are efficient but still lose a significant amount of heat in transportation and from the localization of thermal plants away from urban areas. Part of this will continue the localization of heating units to building natural gas systems in lower-density areas but most of the upgrades will be in the form of improved piping and insulation. (150 Resources per Dice 0/175) (-1 Petroleum Fuels, +1 Petroleum Gas)

[]Cargo Rail Modernization Program: Moving general cargo transport systems towards the use of containers as a universal system demands the production of new railway stock. The program will also include the modernization of several older lines that have been run down from a combination of utilization and inadequate maintenance. Most funding will go towards the expansion of railway stock and the general move towards the use of standard containers for most internal goods instead of more specialized wagons to increase shipping throughput. (160 Resources per Dice 0/150)

[]Academic Network: With the availability of computing hardware and the constant developments on the Erebus systems the possibility of a wider network cannot be discounted. Scientific communications between mainframes have already been demonstrated with messages sent between computers. Expanding this capacity across several central computing centers in major institutes and allowing the direct transmission of information is expected to strongly increase domestic scientific capabilities. Further, as the network would effectively only involve the development of further university datacenters any funding allocated will contribute to the development of local computing power as well.

[]Krasnoyarsk-Irkutsk Metallurgical Complexes(Stage 1-3): Lower-grade local ores in combination with the exploitation of new deposits and improved railway access are expected to significantly improve domestic steel production. The area has practical free electricity from the massive available hydro potential making it uniquely suited to large-scale steel processing and recycling. The proximity of natural gas sources of reduction has favored the area as one of the largest test cases for the primary DRI-EAF method with expectations for significant gains to local work and productivity. Much of the steel produced would go West, lowering local prices and further improving domestic productivity.

[]Secondary Metallurgical Complexes(Stage 1/2): Secondary steel can be salvaged to a large extent from the current steel economy. Despite strong export pressures, the domestic sector for steel utilization is strong and produces an excess of scrap steel. To meet domestic steel demand and minimize the need for reducing agents in production an expanded program for recycling steel can be started. Effective waste filtering has already been established and combustion processing inherently involves the separation of metal products. This will also yield some limited aluminum and copper, but those are secondary and far harder to filter from garbage streams.

[]Donets Coal Basin Mechanization: The wasteful development of the most limited coal deposit in the Union is a mistake, if one that has a significant degree of historical weight. Seams in the region are narrow and problematic for extraction with depth only increasing rapidly as the deposit is increasingly tapped. The reality is that local coal will be depleted in a short time frame no matter what is done and current projects are only accelerating it.

[]Kuzbas Deposit Exploitation(Stage 4/5): Current work at the Kuzbas deposit is of a mixed character with above and belowground efforts increasing in scope. The easy transportation of black coals West along with developed measures for processing brown coals has seen the deposit steadily become more economical. Extraction here is expected to come at a greater cost in labor compared to the larger Northern brown coal deposits, but the lower use of power and better grades of coal will reduce effective costs more.

[]Kansk-Achinsk Basin Exploitation(Stage 5/5): The future of coal power in the Union rests squarely on the shoulders of brown surface-level coals. Current deposits in Kansk-Achinsk represent almost thirty years of extraction capacity to power the whole Union, much less the current rate of extraction. Surface mining of lower-grade coals is dirtier than other coal industries, but energy demands are unlikely to slow, and if the oil crisis is to be navigated then coal must be decisively increased.

[]Atomash(Stage 3/3): Reactor production can still be increased through further funding as a larger hot forging area can be combined with a significantly expanded metallurgical complex. Improving the throughput of materials through the industrial system can raise reactor production as much as reasonably possible, supplying a massive modernization program in the next plan. Current increases will demand more resources and practically necessitate consistent maximum funding to keep the industry operational and competitive with other power sources, (300 Resources per Dice 120/200) (-82 CI8 Electricity +2 Steel +1 Non-Ferrous +1 Educated Labor)

[]Baltic Sea Shipyards: High-capacity container shipping is what the Union is most deficient in and the situation is not improving. River shipping can be built at any private yard to significant quantities much less in focused enterprises but the largest ships need dedicated labor. Massive expansions of yard space and capacity in the Baltic will start to overcome the deficiency. The region can receive thousands of high-paying jobs to compensate for local issues and provide for the Union.

[]Expanded Semiconductor Production: An approximation of the six-micrometer node does exist domestically with laboratory examples but little practical equipment or production for it. Developing further enterprises to produce the equipment to produce the node at a high scale with a high wafer size is a priority to stabilize local supplies of precursors and semiconductors. Current production at the ten-micrometer node is increasing in scale but insufficient for both military and civilian demands, much less expected future demands. Industrial scaling of local semiconductors will steadily improve local production, continuing the move away from single transistors and towards solid-state circuits.

[]Vladivostok Shipyards: The naval yards in the Far East have some of the cheapest labor and a significant market for merchant shipping between all CMEA members. Expanding the construction of large hulled container and tanker ships domestically will be essential to keep up with current American standards. If the Soviet merchant fleet is to be modernized it needs to be funded now and expanded now to compensate for deficiencies in block-wide production. An entirely new generation of ships will have to be built to break with old standards and the dogged obsolescence that has remained a major part of naval construction.

[]Volga Automotive Plant Modernization: Modernization of the Volga industries is necessary to keep up with global car markets and ensure that the domestic sector can continue to be developed. Luxury manufacturers do not inherently need the advantages offered by mass production as much as true mass manufacturers. The series of plants on the Volga directed by VAZ will be modernized and expanded, taking on more workers and further raising domestic car standards. There are still domestic automotive shortages and to fix them requires funding without taking distractions towards luxury vehicles.

[]Orbital Telescope Program: With the capacity of the RLA for heavier launches a larger orbital telescope system can be launched to upstage the Americans. The plan calls for the development and launch of a heavy UV band telescope system able to observe space with far greater precision than American attempts. The primary goal of the program will be the discovery and analysis of new stars, as the field has so far been limited to either light orbital telescopes or terrestrial systems. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Reusable Launchers: The initial MKAS program following the PKA was dismissed by Glushko as an impossible engineering nightmare but it can still be resumed for the sake of providing a lighter launch vehicle. Using long-burning hydrogen engines along with a reusable launcher attached to a drop tank will improve launch capacity and especially if paired with a carrier aircraft reduce costs. The technologies for the project itself are available today with the only issue being the degree of complicated engineering work. It is believed to be possible that some form of the MKAS concept could be launched in the decade allowing space to be opened to low-cost space launch. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Next Generation Hydrogen Launcher: A high-energy hydrogen engine can be paired with an enlarged center stage to improve launch-to-orbit capability and reduce handling prices. A stretched 6m stage alone represents a massive gain in capability when launched using hydrogen, improving the general launch vehicle efficiency. Gains in capacity across all systems are expected along with the development of a dedicated parallel to American high throughput programs. A sling-on launch configuration to the main booster is further expected to enable awkwardly shaped monolithic payloads, coming far closer to the creation of a universal bus for the manned moon and further interplanetary missions. (-20 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[] Long-Term Orbital Nuclear Power: Current generations of space-based reactors have focused on a short service life for the power of a military satellite but more capable longer-term systems can offer further improvements on the concept. A station powered by a reactor capable of generating up to 100kW can undertake scientific experiments previously unheard of for solar-powered systems. Further, long-duration missions to the moon will require the development of power systems more capable than solar and if a permanent base is to be established a reactor program will be instrumental in supplying it with energy. Military demands for high-energy radar satellites cannot be discounted as the capacity to maintain operations in a unified reactor unit can enable constant oceanic overflight and scanning. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Expand Interplanetary Missions: The development and orbital testing of a high-energy nuclear stage represents a major step towards improving space-based capabilities. Nothing in the system is beyond the means of domestic scientific performance and the reactor itself has been tested terrestrially. Starting the project in short order may enable it to fly on probe launches occurring in the next two years, massively expanding the capacity for launch toward far interplanetary trajectories and opening the way towards several ambitious automated missions. Political costs are expected from the use of enriched material but that is nothing that cannot be overcome. (-5 RpY Additional Costs) (1 Dice)

[]Positioning System Programs: The American space program is undertaking a system of global positioning that can directly provide information to military units on their exact location. Replicating it in a broad sense is going to be expensive and unlikely to be available before the end of the decade, but it can be done through leveraging heavier lift systems. These satellites would steadily be placed at a twelve-hour orbit to provide signals down to the ground at a consistent timing, using triangulation to provide navigational information. Developing timekeeping, terrestrial sensor units, and satellite buses capable enough for the task represents a major technical challenge but one that can be undertaken. (-10 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Bulk Launch Methods: The rocket has historically been the only way that payloads and humans have gotten into space, but several other concepts deserve exploration. Everything from structural and design elevations on orbital cable elevators to rocket sleds must be considered. This program itself is only expected to be theoretical and focused on making designs for the possibility along with several small-scale models for scientific viability. Some plans have already been dismissed but investing in the future potential of orbit and easy delivery to space has always been a cornerstone of the program. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)


Light Industry (6) 6 Dice

[]Air Conditioner Plants(Stage 6/8): Air conditioning provides an essential factor towards quality of life in the massive number of unstable climates across the Union. Hot summers and cold winters are practically a universal feature of the climate and that needs to be tamed to accelerate settlement. Expanding the AC program further will be immensely popular as it is essential to start programs to ensure that Americans can be overtaken on general comfort. Local climate conditions strongly favor their employment and there is little reason not to increase their utilization until every apartment and home has at least a portable unit.

[]Mixed Textile Industries(Stage 2/3): The greatest asset available to the Union has been its wealth of carbon resources but we cannot continue in that mode of production. Strengthening the further development of industrial chains towards finished products will improve domestic returns and strengthen local economies. Hundreds of smaller cities in the Union have a demand for low-skill manufacturing labor that has yet to be adequately met. Increasing the production of directly chemically derived fabrics and clothes from them will improve domestic self-reliance along with strongly increasing local turnover. (150 Resources per Dice 78/200) (-38 CI5 Electricity +3 Petrochemicals +3 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Expanded Paper Industries: Demand for paper goods has been mostly adequately met in the last decade as incentive funds have strongly improved production. Further funding efforts are still necessary to maintain low prices and stocks of all types of paper goods both for semi-permanent and immediate consumption. Increasing the scope of production will effectively copy over several luxury products that have remained the focus of the private sector and incorporate them into state circulation. Further, increasing the number of paper mills themselves will likely reduce commodity prices and allow for further development.

[]Expanded Furniture Industries: The next generation of salvaged wood furnishings has already started spreading across the West and the Union. Taking advantage of the craze to lower prices a further number of manufacturers can be set up to take advantage of the new segment. Most of these will be tied to current generations of manufacturing and lumber mills, ensuring that wood products can be adequately and efficiently utilized. The over-production of composite wood also offers an alternative to traditional hardwoods, significantly lowering prices without much degradation in quality.

[]Volga-Ural Petroleum Modernization: Expanding the remit of the Volga-Ural program has been essential to increasing the yields of gas products that are expected to underpin the entire economy shortly. Wells that have previously focused on the enhanced extraction of petroleum can be tapped for gas all while inefficient flaring practices are eliminated to improve efficiency. This will take more funding than previously planned for the project along with expanded electricity use for the established towns and expanded machinery but it should serve to delay oil depletion.

[]Plastic Industries(Stage 4/5): Plastic is practically the defining element of the socialist transition and one that promises to break domestic reliance on imported cotton faster than any ambitious hydrological program. Strong increases in plastic production have been historically insufficient to meet the entirety of demand and the industry needs to aggressively expand to the point that the Union can overcome the stupor of the agricultural past. New horizons of materials can be developed in the future but current demands for basic polyethylene and polypropylene still need to be met.

[]Intensive Cracking Infrastructure(Stage 1/2): Under-refined heavy petroleum products have remained viable products for refinement if with a requirement for improved infrastructure to process. This has resulted in the majority of production being burned to recover some of the energy involved but by expanding the capability oil use can be made more efficient. Previously power-generating heavy fuel oils can be cracked to lighter fractions for the supply of plentiful synthetic lubricants and several useful oil products.

[]Power Plants(CCGT): Current turbine manufacturing capacity is sufficient for a strong increase in electricity production. The development of further gas systems will go a long way towards improving the energy sector and reducing any reliance on conventional oil. Coal production is likely to become more limited in the future with natural gas remaining the one power source capable of currently powering Soviet Industry. Plans call for the establishment of several plants to increase yields, providing a stable base for further grid-scale deployment of gas power.

Agriculture (6) 4 Dice

[]Domestic Meat Programs(Stage 5/10): Dependance on meat imports is likely to remain a factor for as long as the agricultural industry cannot be adequately chemicalized to meet domestic demand. The mass production of chickens offers something of a solution as they are compact, can be grown on less optimal feeds, and produce plentiful secondary products when utilized in high-yield arrangements. Improvements in breeding have already significantly grown the weight of the average chicken, increasing turnover and labor efficiency for conventional facilities. (120 Resources per Dice 143/200) (-29 CI1 Electricity +2 General Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Local Meat Production Grants: A portion of meat production comes from smaller farms of under ten hectares that are established on more marginal lands. These farms originally grew conventional feed crops but have struggled to convert as the hydrological environment has shifted, leaving few options but to expand land under grazing. By providing funding for these conversions along with some improvements in general agricultural policy meat production can be improved without significant losses to primary yields. Further, much of the beef produced through grazing methods is a higher grade than conventional mass production, improving qualitative standards in the industry. (150 Resources per Dice 0/150) (High Profitability)

[]Vegetable Production Modernization: Grain production has kept the Union fed and provided a steady supply of agricultural products to a rapidly growing population but it is inadequate to avoid significant imports of other food products. Current working programs will focus on the improvement of vegetable and fruit cultivation in the parched areas of the Southern Virgin Lands. These crops have comparatively minimal water load to avoid excessive regional stress before larger diversion projects and can continue to yield viable produce. Local low-cost labor and water efficiency improvements can take the program a step further, starting the long process of greening the republics where it is most needed. (100 Resources per Dice 0/250) (High Profitability)

[]Development of the Middle Volga: Irrigation in the great bend of the Volga has historically been inconsistent and problematic but with the additional flow of water south significant improvements can be made. Direct control of water levels up north is expected to stabilize agricultural yields and eliminate any dry years in the basin, improving Soviet agriculture. Current efforts will focus on the increasing allocation of water and the use of more intensive irrigation allowing a final decisive separation from the climate issues that have historically plagued local agriculture. (120 Resources per Dice 0/200) (High Profitability)

[]Development of the Southern Volga: The parched steppe to the South of Stalingrad has historically been marginally developed despite the favorable climate leaving useless wetlands in the far south along with a narrow green band. Diverting local water resources to local terrain would open new prime agricultural land, taking advantage of more consistent river flows to improve the production of several specialty goods. Regional development of water resources is expected to start the transformation of the region, allowing a strong increase in local production along with a general increase in fruit production.

Services (10) 3 Dice

[]Transportation Enterprises(Stage 5/5): Further increases to local truck stocks will increase the demand in the rapidly growing automotive industry but for once it can mostly need the demand. Production of cabover vehicles has increased nearly twenty-fold in the last decade with further gains expected as large and small transportation enterprises are expanded. Work towards improving throughput and efficiency can still be done in collaboration with further road construction to bring the Union into the modern era of internal transportation.

[]Expanding Preparation Schools: Inadequacies of education continue especially for those without access to higher quality primary education as they are set up to fail from the start. Amending this is bluntly incongruous with reality but programs to salvage the most determined students can be started now. Students who are willing to take their summers and fill them with courses of intensive study and the parents willing to support them should have the option to do so. Almost a hundred dedicated summer schools can be set up to test the effect in unused school buildings, allowing those willing and able to reach for higher education to grasp it. (100 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-8 CI2 Electricity +2 Educated Labor)

[]Urban Beautification Programs: Urban development programs have logically proceeded from the drive towards efficiency more than they have for standards of aesthetics. For all the designs that have prioritized constant balcony access and the number of amenities available they have not prioritized aesthetics. The development of large public spaces and parks can be started across several urban areas to enhance the available recreation space outside of standard micro-district layouts. This will come at some cost in old housing stocks but current development programs are adequate to compensate for the loss of obsolescent wartime-era housing. (100 Resources per Dice 0/200)

[]Development of Population Services(Stage 1/3): The rural workers have considerably been ignored by any development in general services and practically left in the dust outside a small set of tepid handouts. This needs to be overhauled and amended to bring the countryside into some sense of modernity. The lower density in the countryside cannot be fixed at any rapid pace and will inform conditions but that does not mean that daily bus routes cannot be established or even some basic service officers. The program itself is large and ambitious but it represents something of a first step towards equalizing town and country.

Bureaucracy 8 Dice

[]Dedicate Focus Towards a Project(): (1 Bureau Dice for +5 per dice on a project, +15 in Chemical Industry) (Unrolled)

[]Comprehensive Ecological Assessments: The Supreme Soviet is going to generate an ecological assessment that comes down harshly on several enterprises and more importantly limits industrial production in critical areas. Some reforms are going to be necessary but there is no reason to disrupt the system too much. By forming an independent commission on the matter and advocating for moderate pragmatic reforms a large portion of the reform effort can either be defanged or pushed through over managerial objections consolidating the petrochemical industry. (1 Dice)

[]Shift Refrigerants: Moving to non-fluorinated refrigerants is expected to reduce direct damage to ozone formation and can serve as a capable political move to undermine the narrative of the ecologically obsessed. The Union committing itself largely and decisively can be easily played up to any number of student groups as doing something for their misguided perception of the environment. It can be conducted for a meaningless and minor cost from ministry funding. The international impact would further allow the Union to produce a bludgeon towards the capitalist nations as those unwilling to follow science, a progressive system of organization, or listen to their ecologists. (1 Dice)

[]Rationalizing Domestic Patent Systems: Automatic licensing requirements have been something of a negative for the storage of foreign patents in the USSR. Reforming away from that would be a step too far, but altering the rules to allow for independent negotiation while grandfathering the currently used enterprises into the system can serve to offer a compromise option. (1 Dice)

[]Free Enterprise Licensing: The licensing of foreign patents has been a mess of commissions and problems with enterprises generally struggling to adapt practically free technological innovations. Officially allowing enterprises to use external patents on their initiative and independently negotiate will lead to a slight increase in technical patent theft. Still, it will accelerate the development of a local technical base. Further, these enterprises can become indebted to the ministry for protecting them once someone decides to try to enforce patent law. (1 Dice)

[]Agricultural Land Reassessment: Going out into the countryside and determining the exact value of the land available has not been done at scale since the immediate post-war plans. Local assessments exist of course but a comprehensive Union-wide one does not. Taking the steps to amend it will not be that much of an allocation and it can be used to proverbially wave the flag for rural party interests. (1 Dice)

[]Expand Town Classification Codes: The tiers of cities and the distinctions between types of towns are an obsolete system that is a holdover from the limited mobility of peasants. Now that the situation has changed, small towns and agricultural areas can move to a more district-based model, allowing for party and state leadership to be consolidated. The program is comparatively popular amongst rural interests and will allow for far better representation without too many complaints. (1 Dice)

[]CMEA Good Prioritization: Cheap goods made by our Socialist allies are a key element of industrialization and there is little reason not to prefer them. Current policies in CMEA trade have technically allowed cross-national purchases but they are still limited due to obsolete Mikoyan era legislation. Fully opening the domestic market will be a decisive step but any enterprise should be able to directly buy from any enterprise in the CMEA. Development will stem from the increase in material production and a decrease in prices with all other factors secondary. (1 Dice)

[]Housing Sector Reform: Current housing programs are working to maintain housing stocks but the massive risk of the Mikoyan era housing decaying has remained a national concern. The homes themselves have held up better than expected but they need to be replaced at an accelerated time frame. Improved apartment models have already been sufficiently developed to reduce costs per unit with current plans simply needing modification. This will commit the Union to the largest housing program in history but in a decade the communal housing form and wartime emergency housing can be left in the past. (1 Dice)

[]Continued Chemicalization Drives: Domestic chemicals must power domestic industries, the Union has massive potential for a world-class chemical industry that is under-realized. Direct subsidy programs to localize the production of most chemical feedstocks along with a more aggressive funding program can be started to achieve total chemical independence. The chemical economy is the economy of the future and only through strengthening the chemical industry can socialism keep up with capitalist development. (1 Dice)

[]Advance an Ecological Program: To accelerate the development of the Soviet State the limits on production must be broken and decisively so. Inadequacies of water supplies have plagued agriculture but that can be disciplined and decisively so. Inadequacies of nutrients have continued to reduce yields and that has been further overcome. By committing entirely to a program focused on ensuring that nature can be tamed for the worker, several radical projects can be advanced for the final transition away from depending on its fickle winds. (1 Dice)

[]Clarify the River Reversal: Party members across the Central Asian republics have continuously championed the cause of river reversal to revive the parched steppe and to solve the coming agricultural crisis. Getting together a block of concerned representatives and party functionaries now will smooth the path toward the adoption of the total plan for river reversal, ensuring that it will be approved and encouraged. There will be some opposition from those from the Urals, but that will be comparatively minor given the rest of the Supreme Soviet. (1 Dice)

[]Assess the Supreme Soviet: Podgorny and Ryzhkov were probably mostly accurate if partially biased on the significant figures of the Supreme Soviet, but it does not hurt to check. More impartial assessments can be conducted now that the ministry has partially stabilized and the party is in a desperate scramble towards the next election. Exact figures are likely to be uncertain before the election but having an accurate picture can greatly help. (1 Dice)

[]Campaign: Working with Ryzkov directly on a combined economic and social platform will be time-consuming and discussing it with local party members even more so. Visiting all the various local allies and associates will take time and hundreds of flights but coordinating messaging will be essential for forming a functional government. Semyonov is at his weakest points and taking an opportunistic but partially conciliatory line with him can yield massive results. (1-4 Dice)


Current Economic Prices(Domestic/CMEA/International): (How this will work is that every action above except for electricity modifies the internal price of the commodities below. They also vary on their own and are sorted into abstracted 1-100 ranges. Modifiers from the rest of your economy are displayed below with each category of goods. When you shift between 20-sized ranges, there can be significant modifiers to the general economy that come from changing prices of core commodities. CMEA prices determine the price in CMEA, though transportation of goods will be a problem with international prices representative of the West.)
