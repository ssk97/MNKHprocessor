Internal Politics:

Political maneuvers have finally somewhat quieted with more typical Supreme Soviet sessions that were reminiscent of the Kosygin era. Both Ryzhkov and Vorotnikov have seemingly come together with common sense moderate policy, at least openly. The two are still somewhat competing for influence through lower party campaigns alongside a focus on out-mobilizing the other in the upcoming election through improved development of the economy. Practical considerations from the lower party have been more focused on the general economy rather than exact responsibility, but the angle has been somewhat good for the ministry. A sudden elevation as the topical expert on what to do to further the economy has somewhat formalized the MNKh as the third chair in government even if formal efforts to retain the position are likely to take longer.

A combination of the LASV crisis and the increase in youth factions of the party have somewhat pushed it towards Ryzhkov's line from a surface level perspective. Conversely, the inclusion of more older workers that tend towards a conservative position with a greater degree of participation may make it lean more towards Vorotnikov leading to a degree of uncertainty for the 79 elections. Recent economic instability has been defining the upcoming political situation as the Union cannot truly afford to endure a recession, especially one that comes from seemingly nothing but current economic policies. Both sides have already asked questions on how to prevent it, presenting a unified front but it is almost certain that the ministry will receive the majority of the blame if it does happen.

Recent financial reports from Cherepovets Steel have highlighted a worrying trend as demand has reduced with several mills starting to reduce employment. The situation is not yet at a crisis point but a strong increase in domestic steel demand is going to be critical to avoid a spiral. At the current economic state a small downturn is almost certain to come as employment is shed from the less efficient sectors of the industry but a deeper recession can be prevented through decisive action. Underfunding of the heavy industrial sector has caused the problem and the only logical way out of the problem is a strong increase in funding alongside further technical development. While reports have not shown the spread of increasing unemployment coming to the broader industrial sector, these are somewhat delayed in practice and sign of a more fundamental concerning trend.

Industrial employment is unlikely to be able to sustain the rapidly growing proletariat with the currently available energy and material resources that are present. Increasing technological sophistication has reduced the economic workforce just as quickly as increasing economic wages. Both factors have started to crush the industrial workforce with most enterprises losing employment through modernization. New funding will somewhat compensate for the loss but that is not going to be efficient from a mass employment perspective. Heavy industry cannot be ignored as it is foundational and critical but it cannot also be relied upon to supply work for millions of Soviet Workers as it once had.

In the order of crises facing the Soviet economy, the heavy industrial one is the most politically sensitive by far. Heavy industry is practically tied into the party and the planning system with a notable decline being a practical guarantee of political collapse. Further, a strong industrial sector underpins national defense and the general construction of socialism domestically and abroad. The Union must resolve this fundamental difference if it is to maintain strong growth as demand must be increased alongside increasing productivity to even maintain the current state of the economy. If the manufacturing industry is allowed to fall, it will take everything politically connected to it. To resolve the issue aggressive demand centric and energy policies can somewhat compensate but the solution itself can only be found in new technical developments.


Military Equipment Part 2(Airforce):

Direct modernization of the now somewhat problematic Mig-23 has failed as Mikoyan has reported that the airframe itself cannot handle the necessary changes to move to a fly by wire model alongside improving engine power. The plane itself is still being fitted with the D-30 turbofan but its long-term modernization potential is unlikely to result in any further gains in performance. Increasing standards of American fighters have already overcome the design with current attempts considered aerodynamically suboptimal for digital system integration. Plans for the Mig-23M have also been cut short due to severe deficiencies in material sciences compared to lightweight American fighters. A related modernization package with the Mysl-M HMD, improved radar, ECM, and countermeasures will still be mounted to provide weapons compatibility but work has shifted towards an entirely new airframe with derivative hardware.

Taking the functional concepts remaining from the Mig-23M and redeveloping it for a high-capability fighter capable of overmatching American developments has begun. The new Mig-27 design program has shifted previous ideas for the fighter, somewhat incorporating lessons learned from the Mig-23B, M, and K. A new composite airframe has significantly reduced empty weight while a fully solid state flight computer directs a fully traversable active canard and rear wing surface to radically improve agility. The delta wing itself has been somewhat expanded to improve carry weight with the intakes moved to a more conventional position so as to provide four additional stations for ordinance. Outside of an entirely reworked electronics suite the new design is somewhat iterative, but represents significant gains in tactical capabilities. A ground attack tracking capable pod is being integrated from the start though the capability remains an option only in situations of mixed or better air superiority.

Modernizations to the Mig-25 airframe have somewhat been taken better as the aircraft was as a baseline more modern and non-dependant on Mig-21-derived components. Some lightning with a new skin has been achieved alongside improved air resistance performance. Conversion to a computerized control system has achieved mild improvements in agility but nothing radical or comparable to more advanced designs. Integration of the Mysl onto the platform with a degree of radar slaving is expected to be key for the mid-range dogfight, enabling the radar to be targeted by sight. Air-to-ground capability integration has been achieved with the integration of Kh-15/25/29s as possible hardware, if only contrast guided variants. Upgrades in capabilities have featured a new high-precision RWR system to improve SEAD performance alongside strong jamming pods capable of screening other assets for use in a tactical support role.

Finalized production versions of the Su-15bis have started being issued to PVO units with twin R25 engines ensuring that the fighter can achieve high-speed interceptions. High power mode for both engines is only sustainable for five minutes but enables a terminal intercept acceleration to Mach 2.4, taking advantage of a more reinforced airframe. A new wing form has been incorporated into the design to reduce air resistance and provide for improved takeoff capabilities in a rapid interception profile. The layout of either three drop tanks and two each of R40A and R60M is expected to be standard for most duties with the option to double missile armament or to replace missiles with R40T's when necessary. Frontline fighter conversions to the use of R13M double mounts have been proposed for export but so far not authorized for lack of reliable customers.

With modern developments in airpower alongside the rapidly improving scale of electronics, avionics, and ordinance the program for a multirole light frontline fighter has started. A single airframe capable of replacing the Su-7, Su-17, Su-24, Mig-23, Mig-27, and Il-42 is technically ambitious but necessary to meet prospective military-tactical missions. Radar capability to sustain four missile datalinks has been a core demand of the program alongside flexible tracking and compound data-sharing between squadmates and downlink from rear echelon radar craft. A single engine capable of delivering 180kN at reheat has already started development with a larger turbofan expected to offer significant efficiency benefits to the airframe. Ordinance compatibility with all next-generation systems has been demanded alongside a maximum number of stores for use in a close support strike role. Prototypes are not expected for a few years as the technical challenges involved are still significant.

The next primary fighter-interceptor has significantly shifted in role from the Mig-25 to a dedicated aircraft focused on air-superiority work both outside and inside defensive zones. The new medium frontline interceptor program has thus accompanied work with several techniques developed to improve air-to-air combat capabilities. A phased array radar is the main goal of the program, integrating simultaneous target tracking with squadron networking and frontal coordination across the battlefield. Reductions in aircraft radar returns can be achieved through improved flight geometry while a new generation of high-power turbines, thrust vectoring, and a solid-state control system will provide unparalleled agility to the airframe. Pilot awareness aids and electronic integration are so far the primary focus of the program as true networked defensive systems will fundamentally revolutionize current concepts of air combat.

Strike aircraft have tended towards heavier airframes for the use of high dive speed ordinance but air defense networks are only improving. This leaves the tactical strike role preferred for a lighter more capable aircraft that can surmount air defenses more so than one capable of carrying the heaviest ordinance. An internal bay with the capability to carry at least three new generation Kh-41 AShM or extended range air-to-air ordinance for over-arctic interception. The agility of the aircraft is not expected or demanded, only that it offers a reduced radar signature from below, as patrol profiles will focus on high-altitude flight more so than low-altitude penetration. The radar system from the MFI has been recommended for the far heavier patrol interceptor when used in the role but systems integration is heavily dependent on technological availability. Practical use cases will see the plane replace the Su-15Bis, Tu-22, and Tu-26 in interception and heavy anti-shipping roles.

A true second-generation semi-active missile with improved kinematic performance and tracking systems has failed to materialize in the new R23. Increasing motor size and a move to solid-state electronics has somewhat improved engagement characteristics of the system with better rejection of chaff and ECM but not significantly so. The largest improvement if anything for the new generation of missiles is an improvement in terminal and kinematic performance, allowing for engagements to be conducted further and against targets maneuvering at up to 8g in most profiles. New double mounting brackets have somewhat been standardized and are expected to be used for wing stores, increasing engagement capacity in dense air environments alongside interception missions.

Lacking interception capability of lighter systems alongside the requirements for long range fires from interceptors has led to a series of improvements in missile development. A new generation of missiles derived from the R-40A has been warranted with a low diameter variation entering testing. Miniaturization of the active seeker has only been partially achieved with a next generation seeker made more capable rather than smaller with improved ECM rejection, continuous data-link updates in TWS modes, and enhanced terminal maneuverability at a moderate cost in kinematic performance. Initial testing of the new R33 system has only started on the Mig-25 but cross compatibility with the Mig-27 is expected upon its entry into service. These features have minimized possible mass reductions with the new missile still expected to be 350kg. Significant improvements in performance have in effect canceled the R40A modernization program with a new significantly improved general purpose system.

To provide a contemporary dogfight missile work has had to shift away from previous attempts at the production of shorter range gun replacements. It is currently believed that the new generation of American missiles will radically improve countermeasure resistance and those efforts need to be paralleled alongside improvements in all aspects of flight performance. The use of a higher energy motor alongside gains in weight are one part of the program, but direct vectoring of engine thrust when combined with Mysl based targeting can enable a nearly total frontal cone of engagement. Seeker improvements are in practice directly copied off the Igla with a dual bandwidth seeker optimized to reject countermeasures and theoretical IRCCM systems expected to be seen on American assault aviation. When combined with a significant narrowing of sensor view, a near absolute resistance to conventional countermeasures is expected outside direct front aspect fire. Practical deployment of the new R73 system is unlikely to start at scale before 1982 but it will provide a means to match and exceed enemy platforms.

Development applications for the Su-24 have been delayed due to issues in the AL-21 engine as modernization has failed to produce notable gains in maintenance duration. The airframe itself has also fallen short of the capabilities expected for a ground attack craft, coming ahead in unloaded surface speed but significantly behind expectation in payload alongside presenting significant safety concerns during takeoffs and landings. Compatibility with both the Kh-25/29 system is still expected alongside the ability to fit ECM and detection hardware for use in SEAD but the upgrade is not enough to offer unique advantages compared to Mig-25s with similar hardware. Advancing adversary air defense capabilities are expected to restrict strike missions to low altitude supersonic attacks, limiting what can be done and demanding an entirely new generation of hardware outside of current developments.

Subsonic attack modes have met significant opposition from the military especially with the results of comparative evaluations. Strike aircraft performing loitering missions over any air defense of significance will have an exceedingly poor survival rate, especially in areas of significant opposition. Improved standoff ordinance is going to somewhat compensate as even subsonic planes can fling missiles from a distance away but that significantly limits operations and raises costs. The Il-42 itself is an adequate plane for the role but the heavy armor incorporated into the fuselage has itself been proven to be part of an obsolete design concept as engagements within AA gun envelopes are deeply unlikely in case of any European confrontation. Work in areas entirely lacking or equipped with obsolete AA can still be conducted but that pigeonholes the aircraft into a series of very limited deployments.

Further development on the Kh-15 system has seen it advanced into a dedicated anti-radar platform capable of long distance attack. High velocity trajectories alongside a terminal inertial stage in case of beam interruption is expected to achieve significant kill rates on hostile SAM and radar systems. Practical limitations of the anti-radar use case has limited the platform to approximately 250 km of range in the attack but even this is expected to be sufficient to counter new and prospective anti-aircraft systems. Minimization of aircraft inside the operational area when breaking into defensive zones is expected to be necessary until the point that sufficient suppression of enemy defenses is achieved. Practical wartime use is expected to take advantage of nuclear warheads to enhance effect, with a co-developed 300 kt warhead made to aid suppression of air defenses. Bomber use as a softening system of Canadian and British air defense networks is expected for the nuclear version, limiting damage to strike formations performing nuclear attacks.

Deriving off initial work in guided ordinance on the Kh-23 platform a new duplex of heavy guided ordinance has been developed for a number of operational tasks. Both the Kh-25/Kh-29 systems share the same practical guidance packages with the former using it on a 300kg system while the latter is a heavier 700kg complex containing a 300 kg warhead. The Kh-25 is expected for lighter front line work alongside anti-tank strikes with options for laser, contrast, and anti-radiation guidance available on the same platform. Range expectations on the lighter missile are in practice at best 15km outside of the anti-radar MP which can cruise for up to forty kilometers alongside having limited inertial guidance for use in a light SEAD role. Kh-29 variants are in practice built with similar seekers but significantly greater more conventional warheads for attacks on hardened targets, significantly expanding strike capabilities on all targeting pod equipped airframes.

Test operations of the new Tu-30 have been successful with the supersonic bomber expected to replace the M3 over time as the principal nuclear strike asset. The variable geometry lifting body has somewhat verified initial estimates of the project even if deficiencies in engine efficiency have caused it to fall short of expected supersonic cruise range targets. Capabilities to maintain cruise speeds of mach 2.4 at 20 km for 8000 km are in excess of any opposition aircraft and make interception of the Tu-30 challenging for conventional enemy fighters. Standard armament is expected to consist of either four still in development Kh-80 nuclear cruise missiles or 4 Kh-41 anti shipping missiles. Replacement of the somewhat obsolete Tu-26 is likely to technically be prioritized first as there are some concerns of the new airframe being economically sustained in a long distance patrolling role like the M3 currently is. Production on the prototype aircraft has come at significant cost in funding and further examples are only likely to be somewhat cheaper, leading to some criticism of the program as a waste of money compared to investments into missile forces.

Infrastructure: (14) 5 Dice

[]Expanded Metro Systems: Metro areas built out by Malenkov and Voznesensky have served hundreds of Millions of workers but further expansions are warranted in cities experiencing rapid growth. Additional routes need to be added in rapidly growing cities in Central Asia and Ukraine, expanding capacity and destinations significantly. More moderate work in several new cities that are expected to connect to the HSR system will be done to provide direct linkages, improving the transfer of passengers. Transportation efficiency improvements will be minor but notable as an increasing number of workers can avoid driving to work. (-1 Petroleum Fuels) (175 Resources per Dice 0/200)

[]Western Local Roads(Stage 1/3): The development of roads is once again in a critical state with significant shortfalls present in the development. Guidance by previous ministers somewhat under-stated the problem as the adoption of automobiles and trucks was persistently and consistently underestimated through the use of obsolescent modeling. Current roads are insufficient, susceptible to wear, and generally inadequate for even a small portion of demanded economic activity. Strong programs to improve them in the west are just a first step in development as the road system across the entire Union must be radically expanded and developed. (150 Resources per Dice 187/275)

[]Automotive Infrastructure(Stage 1/5): The Union was not prepared for its newfound wealth and manufacturing capabilities as the development of cars has put the fact into stark awareness. Moscow is practically a permanent 20 hour traffic jam without much hope in sight while cars litter the micro districts that would otherwise be allocated for green spaces. Developing further parking for the flood of cars alongside provisions on where to store them when not in use can reduce the overall strain on the system. Further work will involve the expansion of urban roads and improvement of traffic throughput through electronic systems, enabling faster transportation without massive increases in spending. (150 Resources per Dice 0/175)

[]Urban Sewage Systems: Sewage transportation by truck is the predominant form of sewage management for much of the Union's land mass. Urban systems exist but capacity limitations have posed significant development concerns outside of Moscow with severe limits placed on what can be done. Current programs focus on the urban issue as trucks, while inefficient, are not a direct health hazard that current management practices are. An expanded and modified program can be undertaken for large-scale urban renewal, integrating processing systems and greatly expanding capacities. This will take time and balloon the program above old standards but it will provide room for the economic centers of the Union to grow. (200 Resources per Dice 16/450) (-34 CI4 Electricity)

[]Water Processing Plants: Water quality in areas of industrial breakthrough has moderately degraded with standards for heavy metals only partially implemented on the industrial end. To ensure that drinking water remains potable an increased number of facilities can be established for the purification of drinking water and improvement of quality of life in industrial zones. This is most notable on the Volga, but secondary water purification facilities for home use water will be required in several key areas. Funding will keep levels to those compatible with long-term health, in effect offering some savings on net medical expenses. (200 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-26 CI3 Electricity)

[]Modernization of Heating Infrastructure: Working to improve the thermal efficiency of structures and re-coating heat pipes is a major infrastructural effort but one that needs to be undertaken to reduce waste. Current practices for grid heating are efficient but still lose a significant amount of heat in transportation and from the localization of thermal plants away from urban areas. Part of this will continue the localization of heating units to building natural gas systems in lower-density areas but most of the upgrades will be in the form of improved piping and insulation. (150 Resources per Dice 0/200) (-2 Petroleum Fuels, +1 Petroleum Gas)

[]Building Cladding Modernization: Improving the cladding on older buildings and increasing insulation standards to modern ones can provide somewhat immediate gains in general efficiency. Gas use for heating has been rapidly increasing in scope and taking minimal measures to prevent it can be somewhat less expensive than increasing the extraction of gas when accounting for the demands of further provisioning infrastructure. Insulation itself will improve the aesthetic appeal of most older buildings, providing a way to break up skylines that are otherwise considered boring for a further minimal cost relative to impact on population morale. (120 Resources per Dice 0/250) (-4 Petroleum Gas)

[]HVDC Grid Islands: High-power thyristors have made direct current electrical transmission somewhat viable if limited in implementation. To improve the economic factors of large-scale hydroelectric facilities along with concentrated peat and lignite-burning thermal stations significant investments can be placed into the field. The long-distance transmission of power for between five hundred and a thousand kilometers can reduce losses and provide a significant improvement in area grids if not local ones.

[]Krasnoyarsk-Irkutsk Metallurgical Complexes(Stage 1/3): Lower-grade local ores in combination with the exploitation of new deposits and improved railway access are expected to significantly improve domestic steel production. The area has practical free electricity from the massive available hydro potential making it uniquely suited to large-scale steel processing and recycling. The proximity of natural gas sources of reduction has favored the area as one of the largest test cases for the primary DRI-EAF method with expectations for significant gains to local work and productivity. Much of the steel produced would go West, lowering local prices and further improving domestic productivity.

[]Secondary Metallurgical Complexes: Secondary steel can be salvaged to a large extent from the current steel economy. Despite strong export pressures, the domestic sector for steel utilization is strong and produces an excess of scrap steel. To meet domestic steel demand and minimize the need for reducing agents in production an expanded program for recycling steel can be started. Effective waste filtering has already been established and combustion processing inherently involves the separation of metal products. This will also yield some limited aluminum and copper, but those are secondary and far harder to filter from garbage streams.

[]Amur Electrolysis Plants: Mass production of aluminum from imported Indonesian Bauxite can start in the Far East to form a key industry and a basis for further development. Plentiful coal and easy logistics on the Amur leave the site optimal for the construction of a major electrolytic complex and the environment is well suited to the import of materials. Intensive development can directly supply the local industry and form a viable component of a complete domestic aluminum-production system as funding and technological sophistication improve.

[]Coal Power Plants(CPSC): Coal is still a necessary part of the energy mix and one that cannot be ignored as it forms an essential basis for increasing energy production. Programs towards radically increasing the throughput of coal power are shortsighted before mining programs can achieve improved yields and an adequate barge route is developed. Still, coal is currently viable and prices of coal are expected to crash once heavier barges can be used, radically changing the entire economic principles of power in the Union. (300 Resources per Dice 0/100) (+150 Electricity +3 Coal) (Repeatable)

[]Virgin Coalfield Exploitation: Test digging at the massive Tunguska, Minusinsk, and Irkutsk deposits and some of the limited far eastern reserves can be started to access previously ignored coal-bearing areas. These programs will focus primarily on the location of hard coals in underground formats to provide high-quality metallurgical coals to specialty industries in the Far East. Avoidance of significant semi-coking processes will be key to reducing the energy demand of the coal industry and maintaining the viability of production until river reversal can be completed.

[]Kansk-Achinsk Coal Liquefaction(Stage 1/2): Collaborating closely with German efforts and transferring the technology or domestic applications offers something of a solution to the oil crisis. A series of integrated plants capable of processing 50Mt of coal per annum can be established alongside the expansion of pit mining to increase transportability. This coal will be converted to fuel at a high rate, securing significant gains in energy security even if current petroleum prices would necessitate operating slightly at cost to maintain prospective capacity. Only so much liquefaction can be developed but it at least offers a way to use domestic resources to meet the needs of the energy crisis. Energy demands will be met with local coal resources while reduction supplies can be obtained through the use of natural gas without economic issues.

[]Atomash(Stage 4/4): Continued expansions of the Atmomash production complex have been deemed important to achieve energy independence. Additional metallurgical facilities alongside a second full oven capable of sintering wholesale cores will be essential alongside the infrastructure required for the turbines to be constructed. At the current rate of development, it is expected that a stable energy system can be achieved by 1990 with new reactor designs accompanied by a rapid increase in production throughput. Replacement of non-grid resources will take longer alongside general modernization but current prospects for atomic energy offer a way out of the current energy crisis.

[]CNC Machine Building Plants: Domestic direct microcomputer-controlled machinery has been somewhat in shortage due to the limitations on production but now that common lithographic machinery is available that trend can be reversed. Standard model NC machinery can be modified and modernized to bring it to true computational control to improve precision and production speed on common parts. Every industry is expected to be revolutionized but only so many chips can be made so quickly as the fabrication machinery is in high demand across every sector.

Expanding the construction of large hulled container and tanker ships domestically will be essential to keep up with current American standards. If the Soviet merchant fleet is to be modernized it needs to be funded now and expanded now to compensate for deficiencies in block-wide production. An entirely new generation of ships will have to be built to break with old standards and the dogged obsolescence that has remained a major part of naval construction.

[]LuAZ Automotive Plant: Lower relative labor costs alongside an environment with easy access to energy and steel resources represents a prime location for the establishment of a heavier vehicle plant. A focus on heavier and larger vehicles can improve market saturation of an otherwise lightly produced category and provide increased consumptive pressure. In more rural areas heavier chassis with an integral 4x4 drive will improve performance and enable a degree of upselling. Export opportunities are further significant as the American industry is currently struggling to produce a modern competitive car for the segment.

[]UMAZ Automotive Plant: Tapping the vast steel production complexes of the Ural region alongside additional materials from local aluminum plants offer significant opportunities for a new generation of vehicles. Ultralight unibodies are expected to be more efficient and capable of urban operation compared to more contemporary vehicles and establish a plant pioneering the new techniques as a breakaway of VAZ. Subcompact designs are increasingly necessary to navigate busy urban streets and the use of innovative techniques will enable lower fuel use across the passenger fleet.

[]Mass Commercialization of UAZ: The current series of 4x4 designs has enjoyed significant popularity in rural areas as a standby vehicle capable of navigating the worst terrain. Models out of military service are already typically resold but designated production of civilian models has not been adequate. Providing a wealth of funding for mass expansion and modernization can bring the typical 4x4 design into common utilization with improved popular trims offered for those that do not want a classical UAZ. Most vehicles will trend lighter to improve popularity but a rural focused light vehicle can garner a considerable market.

To improve economic activity further funding can be allocated on the expansive production of luxury cars so as to improve general economic conditions. As the population gets wealthier the demand for luxury has only risen with significant demand placed on providing the most capable trims available. Close cooperation with Nissan is expected with some technical transfer promised as long as sufficient funding is allocated, driving the domestic sports car industry forward by approximately five to ten years.

[]Open a New Moon Program: A theoretical program to upstage American achievements in orbit of the moon can be undertaken for comparatively little cost. Launching an FGB-VA is a matter of attaching a stage to it and performing an orbit as the duration of travel is expected to be unexceptional the same as the mass involved. This would encourage expensive domestic spending programs on the American end, especially as a landing is still believed to be technically infeasible in any configuration of proposed launchers available. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

[]Superheavy Launcher: With the limited capabilities of the RLA new systems have to be developed if a new moon program is even to be considered. A high-power hydrogen lift stage can still be paired with legacy RLA cores produced as cheaper boosters but new engines will have to be developed to enable a degree of reusability. Recovery of comparatively short-duration boosters will be key for lowering costs and on a heavy core hydrogen state the flight profile can be well suited for further launches. Mixed cryogenics will be a major issue but the limitations of hydrogen and transport diameters somewhat prevent any other approach. (-30 RpY Expected) (1 Dice) (Subvote)

[]New Heavy Launcher: An all-hydrogen lift vehicle promises to significantly reduce the requirements for a rocket and enable a lower general mass of dry components to be used. The design is planned around a six-hundred-ton liftoff vehicle built on a two-stage basis using a hydrogen lower and upper stage with the options for mounting the already developed high-energy third stage for geostationary launches. A six-meter core diameter would enable fairing diameters up to nine meters, enabling far larger payloads to be launched in a single flight and starting the way toward retiring the RLA-3. (-25 RpY Expected) (1 Dice) (Subvote)

[]Light Bulk Launcher: The RLA-1 is frankly excessive for most missions it has been considered for as a simple crew rotation does not require fifteen tons of lift mass. Improved electronics on most satellite buses have also eliminated the need for the heaviest launches due to the shrinking size of vehicles. Working off existing hardware by consolidating the lower stage to a half-power engine alongside a more efficient fuselage can provide approximately eight tons to orbit on a reliable platform. This would involve some configurational changes but could create a highly capable launch vehicle for lighter payloads to avoid the full cost of an RLA launch. (-15 RpY Expected) (1 Dice) (Subvote)

[]Bulk Launch Methods: The rocket has historically been the only way that payloads and humans have gotten into space, but several other concepts deserve exploration. Everything from structural and design elevations on orbital cable elevators to rocket sleds must be considered. This program itself is only expected to be theoretical and focused on making designs for the possibility along with several small-scale models for scientific viability. Some plans have already been dismissed but investing in the future potential of orbit and easy delivery to space has always been a cornerstone of the program. (-5 RpY Expected) (1 Dice)

Smaller homes and older apartments are being modernized but at an inadequate pace with the acceleration of conventional construction. Further programs to increase the throughput of cooling systems can ensure that the oldest housing stock is modernized and brought into a comfortable state of living over the next decade. Once sufficient production capacity is established efficiency improvements are expected to provide a sufficient demand impetus to maintain profitability, solving the standard of living crisis compared to the Americans.

The production of new lithography machines is still somewhat questionable as lines are still in the process of conversion but steady amounts have become available. Improvements in wafer size or leaps in machine capability are unlikely to be made this decade but improvements in photomasks have already started and are likely to achieve gate reductions to 3.5um without radical machinery changes before 1980.

[]Modernization of Home Electronics: Gorky era industrial standardization programs have been key and heavily influential in nearly every element of the electronics industry but they need to be brought to modern standards. Power supply minimum efficiencies, indicators for efficiency, and several component standards need to be updated and improved. More advanced techniques have revolutionized the industry and it is time to move most consumer items to them. Changeovers are planned for the next five years with the majority of funding going to bureaucratic enforcement and incentive funds to ensure that enterprises can change over with few disruptions. (240 Resources per Dice 64/100) (+10 CI2 Electricity +1 Non-Ferrous +1 Petrochemicals) (High Profitability)

[]Third Generation Food Programs(Stage 1/3): The chemical industry has delivered the Union several major victories in the production of shelf-stable enhanced foods that have practically broken from old traditions. These are capable of long-term storage on shelves and can in effect reduce food wastage and contamination significantly through a mixture of new chemical compositions and plastic packaging. Production expectations will be major as several new types of drinks, meals, and even fast-consumption products will be brought to every soviet grocer. Current efforts are expected to modernize the soft drink industry along with sectors of the confectionary industry, contributing capital to bring manufacturing to new standards. (160 Resources per Dice 0/200) (-41 CI3 Electricity +4 Petrochemicals +3 General Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Secondary Plastics Industries: Plastics are objectively superior to any contemporary product produced in the Soviet Union and current shortages of non-ferrous metals can be somewhat compensated for through the rapid adoption of plastics. Increased production of containers and several other thermoplastic products for use in general use of durable goods will be key to lowering the demand for metals and conserving them for more important sectors. In practice, the reduction in metal use will be minimal if only due to the likely rapidly rising demand for new goods overtaking any savings. (180 Resources per Dice 0/200) (-36 CI3 Electricity -2 Non-Ferrous +6 Petrochemicals +2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Textile Industry Overhauls: Current labor standards are reducing efficiency for the general textile industry as the massive profusion of labor is increasingly more scarce. Enterprises have asked for funding for further modernization as cheap labor is not available for use in the textile industry and machinery must be used to compensate for the deficiency. Limitations in immigration and a strong domestic growth pattern have consumed easy-to-mobilize labor leaving little that can be done. Increasing mechanization for common goods will compensate but the general sustainability of the industry must be considered. (200 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-48 CI9 Electricity -2 General Labor +1 Educated Labor) (Very High Profitability)

[]Mixed Textile Industries(Stage 3/3): Rapid chemicalization of the clothing sector promises to direct water towards more useful industries while improving general domestic growth. Synthetic fibers are superior to natural ones in most ways and adapting industrial methods to primarily produce them will practically eliminate any dependence on imports of materials. Programs to achieve increased industrialization have run into minor issues in sourcing labor but a few workers can still be offered sufficient wages to increase textile production and processing.

Chemical Industry (6) 4 Dice

[]Exploitation of the East Siberian Basin(Stage 1/2): Several previously untapped petroleum reserves exist in the Far East with exploratory drilling already started on several identified fields. Most reservoirs that have been found are a combination of small and remote reserves without massive capacity for new production, but they are existent and worth extraction in a primary and secondary recovery sense. Continued operations are unlikely to produce any radical increases in petroleum production but even mild gains can assist in stabilizing economic activity.

[]Development of the Southern Turgay Basin(Stage 1/2): Expansive extraction operations in the Kazakh SSR are expected to stimulate the local economy and provide a mixture of gas and petroleum resources for rapid development. Local reserves are comparatively small and somewhat challenging to access but intensive production can provide rapid and significant gains for the local economy. Construction of several new oil towns alongside the intensive expansion of local refining infrastructure is expected to produce thousands of new high-paying jobs and tens of thousands of jobs supporting them. Operations are going to be limited by the conditions of the reserves in place but some gains are still expected.

[]Intensive Development of the Caspian(Stage 2/6): The caspian basin still has a vast quantity of oil all around it in both the littoral waters and the ground around the sea. Further increases in on-sea production will tap the remaining deposits on the water with further efforts focused on increasing recovery and conventional extraction on the rest of the reserve. Improvements in production will somewhat increase in price due to the more advanced techniques put into use but that is to be expected to sustain the requirements of new oils. (180 Resources per Dice 79/125) (-15 CI6 Electricity -5 Petroleum Fuels -3 Petroleum Gas +1 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Modernization of Oil Fields(Stage 1/4): Moving towards the newest techniques and implementing tertiary recovery measures at scale for the West Siberian deposits will generate rapid returns on investment. Bringing older depleted wellheads into functionality and expanding the utilization of active fracking techniques is expected to radically reshape the petroleum industry. Well, recovery rates can be nearly expected to double, especially for some heavier oils with techniques raising profits across the board for essential state enterprises. Current approaches will focus on increasing recovery from already tapped wells but continued programs can be expanded towards general improvements in petroleum recovery. (160 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-39 CI4 Electricity -5 Petroleum Fuels -4 Petroleum Gas) (High Profitability)

[]Continued Synthetic Rubber Programs: Continued deep modernizations and expansions of the domestic rubber industry offer a way to significantly improve domestic incomes while increasing independence. Direct expansions of the industry are technologically possible through improved techniques, providing flexible and higher-performance polymers to several other critical industrial areas. Work on the overall rubber industry is only expected to increase as the automotive and general industrial sectors reach maturity with the demand for improved sealants and synthetic products rapidly increasing.

[]Next Generation Plastics Programs: Expanding the production of specialty and engineering plastics is somewhat of a distraction with the strong growth of the industry but one that still needs to be addressed. New and improved feedstocks and a rapidly developing chemical industry driven by cheap energy is a viable export industry and one that can significantly contribute towards domestic growth. Increasing funding for the more experimental applications of new plastics including the wholesale replacement of stainless steel in some applications will be key to improving domestic competitiveness and technological sophistication. (240 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-41 CI6 Electricity +4 Petroleum Gas -4 Petrochemicals +1 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Continued Exploitation of Volga-Ural: The tapping of massive reserves at an accelerated pace can provide for a cheap and fast increase in petroleum production to compensate for depletion in other areas. The massive formations are steadily decreasing in productivity as exploitation continues to deplete reserves despite improved recovery methods and the continuous development of new methodologies. These initiatives would in practice accelerate the depletion of deposits in the region, yielding plentiful cheap oil from the massive formations but causing a faster loss of total production as oil becomes uneconomical.

[]West Siberian Gas Wells(Stage 1/10): Vast gas reserves exist in the West Siberian petroleum formations and outside of efforts for capture from primary wells the development of dedicated local gas infrastructure has not yet begun at scale. Technical programs to tap new gas wells and significantly increase production capacity represent the best means for reducing oil use across the Union. Initial programs will focus on tapping newly discovered reserves and proving the techniques involved more than direct extraction but far larger and more productive efforts are sure to follow.

[]Heavy Oil Experiments: There are approximately six million tons of recoverable heavy oil and bitumen that are somewhat economically and technically recoverable. Current upgrading facilities have proven that it can be refined into usable oil products but not at significant rates and not without costs. Accepting that the technologies developed for refinement will not be mature for this plan, some funding can still be transferred over to improve the production of new oil products and open the processing of energy reserves previously considered unusable. (200 Resources per Dice 0/150) (-43 CI5 Electricity -2 Petroleum Fuels -4 Petrochemicals +1 General Labor +1 Educated Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Intensive Cracking Infrastructure(Stage 2/2): Direct upgrading infrastructure can be constructed to take advantage of the current surpluses of heavier oils. Instead of direct combustion or the production of more valuable synthetic lubricants, production can go somewhat to direct upgrading. New compounds will inherently be produced from cracking to maintain a high-value production chain but some of it can easily be allocated towards fuels instead of a true multi-stage processing approach. Improved refinery infrastructure past this point can provide some minor technical gains but that is miniscule compared to improved extraction.

Agriculture (6) 4 Dice

[]Domestic Meat Programs(Stage 7/10): Meat independence outside of beef requires a concentrated effort to increase and optimize the production of pork. Pig stocks have rapidly increased for the production of specialty goods but general-purpose pork has only moderately expanded during the previous plan. A concentrated effort to radically increase the number of pigs raised and slaughtered in the Union will be essential to overcoming any shortcomings of the domestic meat industry. Initial concepts will continue the caloric optimization of the pig with breeding programs initiated to produce pigs that can more efficiently take on calories, grow faster, and efficiently use lower-grade feeds without excessive loss of productivity. (120 Resources per Dice 6/225) (-34 CI1 Electricity +1 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Development of the Middle Volga: Irrigation in the great bend of the Volga has historically been inconsistent and problematic but with the additional flow of water south significant improvements can be made. Direct control of water levels up north is expected to stabilize agricultural yields and eliminate any dry years in the basin, improving Soviet agriculture. Current efforts will focus on the increasing allocation of water and the use of more intensive irrigation allowing a final decisive separation from the climate issues that have historically plagued local agriculture. (120 Resources per Dice 147/200) (High Profitability)

[]Development of the Dnieper: Every drop of fresh water that enters the Black Sea is a drop that is stolen from the Soviet worker. Seizing back the water and constructing a reservoir system with diversions off the river combined with the management of solar evaporation can preserve local water resources and significantly improve growth capacity. Solving any risk of drought through hydrological means has long been a goal and a target for development and with one series of cascades and expansions to the current water infrastructure a major river can be tamed and brought to useful production. (120 Resources per Dice 150/200) (High Profitability)

[]Water Efficiency Programs: The defining factor of the agricultural industry is the inputs put into the soil with the material acting more so as a temporary storage medium than an inherent factor. Continuing to provide improvements in water efficiency will stabilize the supply of one essential part of the equation as the chemical industry hammers away at feedstock shortages from the other direction. Drip irrigation requires a vast amount of plastic to implement and sustain but given the domestic industry that can be met to entirely solve issues of water accessibility. We now have the opportunity to break away entirely from the cycle of droughts that has plagued Russia and the Union, all that is needed is a final decisive effort. (120 Resources per Dice 0/350) (+6 Petrochemicals) (High Profitability)

[]Solve the LASV Problem: Instead of hesitating with the liquidation of rats and mice, new measures can be put in place to reduce their populations and incidents of LASV. A program working with second generation anti-coagulation agents can be started and expanded massively with the distribution of vast amounts of poisonous pellets conducted to cut down on local populations. Ecological damage is expected but stopping excess deaths should come well before over-sensitive ecologists that are more focused on admiring greenery then saving people. Exact attritional rates are somewhat untested but cuts at the food supply level will steadily reduce populations and ideally prevent a summer viral peak. (200 Resources per Dice 0/150) (+2 Petrochemicals)


Services (16) 11 Dice

[]Transportation Enterprises(Stage 5/5): Further increases to local truck stocks will increase the demand in the rapidly growing automotive industry but for once it can mostly need the demand. Production of cabover vehicles has increased nearly twenty-fold in the last decade with further gains expected as large and small transportation enterprises are expanded. Work towards improving throughput and efficiency can still be done in collaboration with further road construction to bring the Union into the modern era of internal transportation. (180 Resources per Dice 79/250) (+5 Petroleum Fuels +4 General Labor) (Locked Until Western Local Roads is Completed) (Very High Profitability)

[]Expansion of Domestic Media Production(Stage 1/2): Current film and animation enterprises have significantly expanded into the vast demand for cultural production but more funding can be transferred over to further increase them. A series of films from the state sector can be commissioned on several important topics alongside the adaptation of several literary works into the film format. This will be accompanied by improving the facilities for art schools and providing a series of scholarships for young authors willing to study the craft further and continue developing high throughput cultural production.

[]CNG Distribution Programs: Shortages of petroleum fuel are nearly expected given the current limitations in production and the physical reality of requiring a six times price increase to make the arctic fields viable. Efforts to start tentative conversions of transport in cities to natural gas focusing on dual fuel systems for cabovers and buses. Easy conversion targets are expected as local transit can be converted using current infrastructure with a relatively minimal commitment of funds and technical efforts. None of the systems are in themselves novel and a pilot program now can demonstrate the concept for future use. (150 Resources per Dice 0/100) (-1 Petroleum Fuels, +1 Petroleum Gas)

[]Expansion of Assistive Services: Some mild deficits exist in the care for pensioners that is available as the health system has so far almost entirely prioritized work for working populations. Shifting some resources away from sectoral growth towards skilled nursing and assisted retirement services is a waste but one that can be justified with shifting population demographics. Longer general lifespans are expected to stress current pension schemes much less future healthcare resources and heading off the upcoming political firestorm with a token effort can sidestep much of the criticism. (150 Resources per Dice 0/175) (-16 CI2 Electricity +2 Educated Labor)

[]Restaurant Assistive Funding: Expansions of public eateries can significantly improve profitability and support a key high-return sector. The public demand for pre-cooked food has strongly increased with accompanying increases in incomes and it is essential to meet that demand. Funding programs for the largest organized enterprises and supportive partial funding for several key expanding private chains can be coordinated to increase sectoral throughput. Massive and radical expansions of these enterprises can consume labor at a prodigious rate, mobilizing the population to sell minor conveniences to more relevant workers.

[]Second Wave Hotel Programs(Stage 1/3): Current business supporting infrastructure is deeply lacking compared to the West as there are in practice two centralized hotel-focused enterprises of mediocre quality. Developing a further three hotel enterprises with one targeting the high-end sector and two aiming to be as inexpensive as possible will improve support for travelers and significantly aid local incomes. Business infrastructure will readily apply to general tourism such that improving both will provide local areas with more access alongside gains in general economic efficiency. (150 Resources per Dice 0/125) (-16 CI2 Electricity +1 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Expanding Roadside Logistics(Stage 2/2): Fuel provisions for the most common vehicles are still lacking in effect limiting the mobility of passenger vehicles. Extended-range operations and staying in the inhabited belt have somewhat ameliorated current problems but further expansions are still needed to fully support the rapid increase in consumer car ownership. Reinforcement of urban gas stations alongside those in smaller cities will be essential for the program to ensure that queues are minimized and transportation access is improved. (120 Resources per Dice 85/150) (-15 CI2 Electricity +3 Petroleum Fuels +2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Expansion of the Postage System: Higher speed postage has imposed several requirements on the postage system and ones that can only be partially met. Increased commercial activity has accompanied a significantly increased demand for the postage system, especially for accelerated delivery. Working to address the matter requires a multi-faceted approach with some conversions of HSR trains to mail transporters during the low utilization periods proposed. This will accompany a major expansion of postal services, increasing population access to the service and ensuring that high-speed mail can be sent both faster and cheaper. (140 Resources per Dice 206/225) (-26 CI2 Electricity +1 Petroleum Fuels +2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Storage-Distribution Networks(Stage 2/2): Continued developments of the transportation and distribution system can be extended towards commercial services. Enterprises and smaller businesses have an endless demand for the transportation of goods and expanding services to meet that demand can significantly improve overall economic function. Programs started now will directly target the expansion of commercial mail services ensuring that packages are rapidly and competently delivered across the Union. This infrastructure will not fundamentally change the economy, only providing alternative transportation services to provide for smaller scale operations. (100 Resources per Dice 71/200) (-16 CI2 Electricity +2 General Labor) (High Profitability)

[]Distribution of Professional Services: Expansions of the professional service sector need to be conducted to the point that standardized legal and general consultations are available to the average worker. The development of the program will be key in stabilizing the environment for smaller enterprises to be competitive and receive adequate guidance on the navigation of the system. Comprehensive developments would in effect prioritize providing more junior graduates as something of a training program, ensuring that professions outside of direct state control are adequately trained.

[]Population Distribution Programs(Stage 3/5): The comprehensive expansion of store fronts and general distribution stores to mixed use and urban areas has been somewhat neglected due to the somewhat integrated nature of the housing program. Older constructed areas have ended up constructed to lower standards with corner and grocery stores focused on to the exclusion of more specialty goods. Demolishing some lower floor living areas for conversion into vibrant commercial areas is expected to improve overall economic turnover and expand general demand pressure. New structures can be modified to include some commercial spaces for the next generation of housing programs, further providing gains in both availability and population density.

Bureaucracy 8 Dice

[]Dedicate Focus Towards a Project(): (1 Bureau Dice for +5 per dice on a project, +15 in Chemical Industry) (Unrolled)

[]External Outreach Enterprises: New types of enterprises will be needed to ensure an adequate influence over oil production in foreign nations. In-practice control by Soviet officials is one line, but steps must be taken to increase power and influence through the limited provision of more advanced drilling equipment. Closing the supply chain in foreign nations can produce additional petroleum and provide a high-capability diplomatic arm that will guarantee a steady supply of oil. The MFA disagrees somewhat on the policy, but their remit is not the economy and nothing they can do will solve the energy crisis short of bumbling into a nuclear war. (1 Dice)

[]Restart a Labor Commission: Verifying the developments of Voznesensky and expanding the assessments of labor can help to continue to provide a scientific basis for improved productivity. Current work hours are optimized for a mixed productive-demand state but can likely be shifted to optimize other aspects essential to economic activity especially now that labor demand has rapidly increased. Maintaining a balanced demand state will be key for stable economic growth especially now that the baby boom is slackening and newly graduating students are available in lesser quantities. (1 Dice)

[]Work Around Ryzhkov: The supreme soviet has so far accomplished little of economic relevance with a focus around the modification of work practices more so than tangible economic issues. Ensuring that Ryzhkov is left out of the decision loop of essential ministry work by directly communicating with Vortnikov is expected to provide some advantages politically as the council of ministers is technically empowered to make most economic decisions. This separation of decision making from the Supreme Soviet is technically a power grab, but a minor one and one that would greatly narrow the degree of necessary maneuvering required for attaining a higher position. (1 Dice)

[]Army-Ministry Budget Requests: The MoD has had too much of a budget for too long and cutbacks are going to be needed to stimulate economic growth. Economic growth forms the basis of the military and the technologies involved rendering it a higher priority to achieve instead of the development of some new overpriced weapon system. Belik is currently somewhat politically weak and not the best liked, providing an opportunity to intercede on the next budget to allocate surplus funding, stopping the growth of the defense budget. (1 Dice)

[]Expanding Health Ministry Funding: Taking a strong stance against a disease is well and good but funding for the process can come from other aspects of state development. Maintaining the economy under the stress of the disease is already a major problem and further reductions in funding will only degrade productivity. Moving the supreme soviet to expand funding by taking from less important ministries will make some enemies but it will also be a decisive response to the crisis and start the process towards solving it. (1 Dice)

[]Retaliations against the Lazy: Those who have refused modernization orders are somewhat in their right to do so, but the lack of willingness to follow orders must in itself be punished through examples. Allocations of new employees can be prioritized around non-compliant departments with political appointments steadily increasing the work alongside ordering more loyal management to alter local conditions. If they are unwilling to follow orders the least they can do is do the proper work expected of them for the sake of the ministry. (1 Dice)

[]Stimulus Measures: The combination of the Virus alongside flagging growth in conventional industrial sectors can be justified as a sign of the somewhat expected delayed economic downturn. Using that to justify increased funding may result in it getting applied too early but the increased growth demands present will require further allocations of resources and material. A partial increase will be asked for and likely granted, increasing state debts so as to avoid a significant economic downturn. (1 Dice) (Immediate 3000R, Repaid at 500/y for 7 years)

[]Gas Implementation Commission: Committing funding towards the mass gasification of the economy is necessary with the current and expected price balances. Local reserves of gas are far more notable and easier to extract when compared to available oil reserves. Increasing an emphasis on gas alongside funding several new applications in automobiles, aircraft, and general energy use can be done now to prepare the techniques for future implementation. Energy access will define the future of the superpower competition and it is imperative to secure it for victory. (1 Dice)

[]Automotive Reforms: Automotive demand is a core part of heavy industrial growth but slow increases in production have plagued the sector, especially with the lack of allocated enterprise funding. Reversing this will take more time but first reforms can be instituted to open the roads to more motorists, incorporating infrastructure to increase the density of car use and provide for expanded registration. Unified examination standards that do not require as much of an educational basis will increase accessibility and ensure a steady demand base that will further drive economic expansions. (1 Dice)

[]Housing Sector Reform: Current housing programs are working to maintain housing stocks but the massive risk of the Mikoyan era housing decaying has remained a national concern. The homes themselves have held up better than expected but they need to be replaced at an accelerated time frame. Improved apartment models have already been sufficiently developed to reduce costs per unit with current plans simply needing modification. This will commit the Union to the largest housing program in history but in a decade the communal housing form and wartime emergency housing can be left in the past. (1 Dice)

[]Expand Ministry Personnel: Expanding the extent of the ministry further and increasing the extent of the office alongside outreach state capacity can be expanded. The economy has only steadily grown more complex and the ministry needs an expanded investment arm to ensure that the Soviet economy stays modern. Delegation to the enterprises has minimized bureaucratic overheads but the complexity of the economy is still a major burden on the ministry that more personnel can solve, at least for a time. (1 Dice) (Subvote) (Options to Gain more Dice)

[]Brief Lyudmila: Current politics is a pit of vipers that is not well suited to someone prone to emotional outbursts. Working with her to ensure that she knows what reliable figures there are in politics will ensure that the ministry is well run and having a deputy with a softer touch can be a key asset. If nothing else, she is capable of managing significant areas of infrastructure development and can be confined to the area until a more competent deputy can be found. So far the woman has avoided doing anything idiotic with focused work in the development of local infrastructure with little administrative necessity, enabling a possible state of benign neglect so as to let her focus on important work over any impossible ambitions. (1 Dice)

[]Expand CMEA Collaboration: If the energy crisis that is clearly coming to the view of everyone with a brain is to be surmounted, closer cooperation with CMEA must be started. Euro implementation is a good first step but further improvements in energy infrastructure must be pushed through. Vast quantities of gas practically too cheap to meter will be made available soon and providing agreements that set a low price for it in advance will enable governments to start investments now. Hookups to primary pipelines will not be sufficient to entirely shift energy and heating away from oil but the first steps can be made to circumvent economic instability. (1 Dice)

[]Stop Ecological Complaints: Several university graduates have produced prolonged and absolutely useless reports on the excess development of industry alongside associated sacrifice zones. In their misguided view the policy is susceptible to over reach as the areas involved have increased in scale alongside prevalence in the last ten years of intensive industrial development. To undermine them and ensure that the topic of discussion is eliminated at the source efforts can be made to increase the correct study of the phenomenon alongside implementing guidelines for maximum population impacts allowed in non-sacrifice zones so as to better use the Union's vast wealth of land. (1 Dice)

[]Discredit Ecological Programs: Those who talk of greening and slowing the engineering of nature until it bends to the workers' whim only want to go backward towards primitive capitalist accumulation. Current green energy efforts are being continuously propagandized as an utter failure in the development of a technique utterly incompatible with maintaining industrial efforts but the program can be taken a step further. Ecological programs can be directly undermined at every step with studies pushed to counter any narrative of devastation and undermine the delusional approach towards nature honoring the untouched wild for no other reason than boredom with urban life.

Current Economic Prices(Domestic/CMEA/International): (How this will work is that every action above except for electricity modifies the internal price of the commodities below. They also vary on their own and are sorted into abstracted 1-100 ranges. Modifiers from the rest of your economy are displayed below with each category of goods. When you shift between 20-sized ranges, there can be significant modifiers to the general economy that come from changing prices of core commodities. CMEA prices determine the price in CMEA, though transportation of goods will be a problem with international prices representative of the West.)
